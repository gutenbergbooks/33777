<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>In these days of zealous reform in school methods, it
is well to keep in mind the true aim of all education,&mdash;the
right development of character. It is
important that our children acquire extensive knowledge,
and sound habits of thought; it is imperative that they
become honest, steadfast, and manly. Dr. Arnold, as
head-master of Rugby School, was eminently successful
in attaining this object. In "Tom Brown's School Days,"
Mr. Hughes has caught, and immortalized, the spirit of
his old teacher's work. While the book emphasizes the
peculiar moral earnestness of Dr. Arnold's pupils, it is
free from all suspicion of cant. Those who enjoy its pages
should read also Dean Stanley's admirable life of the
great schoolmaster. We trust that it will be many years
before we cease to read the life of Mr. Hughes in his
daily works of goodwill to his fellow-men.</p>

<p>The notes have been prepared for children in the grammar
school, as explained in Mr. Ginn's preface to the
"Lady of the Lake," in this series.</p>

<p>A few passages have been omitted from the original
text, in the belief that it will thus be better adapted for
the use of American schoolboys; and the typographical
errors of former editions have been corrected.</p>

<h2>THOMAS HUGHES.</h2>


<p>Thomas Hughes is a native of the royal county
of Berkshire, England. From the nursery windows
of the old farmhouse in Uffington, where he was born, in
1823, he delighted in looking out on that famous White
Horse Hill which he describes in the opening chapters of
"Tom Brown's School Days."</p>

<p>His father was such an English squire as he represents
Tom's father to be, and his grandfather was vicar of the
parish, and therefore a man of a good deal of local influence.
When a child, young Hughes must have become
familiar with the old parish church, which dates almost
from the time of William the Conqueror, and which has
within it some Roman brickwork which carries one back
to the days when Agricola's legions were building walled
towns in Britain.</p>

<p>Thus the lad's earliest recollections would naturally be
of these two landmarks&mdash;the ivy-grown church, with its
twenty and more generations buried round it, and the
great chalk hill whose rudely carved White Horse can be
seen gleaming in the sunshine full ten miles away, just as
it did when Alfred the Great cut it to commemorate his
victory over the Northmen a thousand years ago.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg viii]</span>
Thomas had a brother George, who was a little older
than he, and who was his opposite in many respects.
From him he learned many lessons which helped to shape
his after life. George was quick to turn his hand to anything,
and a lover of all out-door sports; if they had a
spice of danger in them, so much the better. Thomas,
on the other hand, was naturally both awkward and timid;
the sound of a gun frightened him; and a pet pony soon
found that, while George was his master, he was Thomas's,
and meant to keep so. Thomas was ashamed of what he
called his two left hands, with which he never seemed to
get the right hold of anything the first time. He was still
more ashamed of his timidity. That feeling of fear he
could not prevent. Eventually, however, he did better; he
so mastered it that he could bravely face what he feared,
so making duty stand him in the stead of that mere physical
courage, which is often but another name for insensibility
to danger.</p>

<p>When he reached the age of seven he went to Twyford
to school. Here he found how easy it is to get a nickname,
and how hard it is to get rid of it. One of his
first lessons related to Greek literature and to the history
of Cadmus, who was said to have "first carried letters
from Asia to Greece." Instead of asking the question in
the book, the master demanded, "What was Cadmus?"
This new way of questioning disconcerted the class, who
were prepared to tell who Cadmus was, but not what he
was. But young Hughes, remembering the letter-carrier
at Uffington, suddenly jumped up and shouted out, "I can
tell! Cadmus was a postman, sir!" From that day the
boy was christened "Cadmus" by his companions, a name
which, for convenience' sake, was soon shortened to "Cad,"&mdash;a
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg ix]</span>
particularly aggravating abbreviation, since in England
a "cad" is the exact opposite of a gentleman. Then all
sorts of ingenious and mischievous changes were rung on
it until poor "Cadmus" was in a fair way of being driven
wild with torment. Wherever he went the walls echoed
with the jeering cry. But luckily for him his brother
George happened to hear a big fellow teasing the lad,
and rushing up with clenched fist and blazing eyes,
thrashed the bully so soundly that after that Thomas
enjoyed entire immunity from the objectionable title.</p>

<p>After about three years at Twyford, the two brothers
were sent to the school at Rugby, then under the mastership
of Doctor Arnold, who proved himself to be the
ablest teacher in England; not because he taught his
boys more than any other educator, but because more
than any other he awakened in them the true spirit of
manhood. "Tom Brown's School Days" is a record of
the eight happy years that the lads spent under the Doctor's
influence. From Rugby they went to Oxford, where
Thomas Hughes graduated at Oriel College in 1845. The
timid "Cadmus" of Twyford not only passed through
Rugby with credit to himself in foot-ball, in Greek verses,
and in the manly art of self-defence, but he got a "Double
First" at Oxford&mdash;that is, the highest honors in the mathematics
and the classics&mdash;and was elected captain of the
'Varsity Crew and captain of the University Eleven at
cricket as well.</p>

<p>It was while young Hughes was at Oriel that the corn
law agitation reached its height. A heavy duty on all
imported grain had made bread so dear that thousands of
English workmen, with their families, were brought to the
verge of starvation. John Bright earnestly espoused their
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg x]</span>
cause and urged Parliament to repeal a tax that enriched
a few at the expense of a suffering multitude. Elliott, the
"Corn Law Rhymer," stirred the feelings of the masses
with his impassioned appeals in verse, so that all over the
country hollow-cheeked artisans were repeating the lines,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><p>
"England! what for mine and me,<br />
What hath bread-tax done for thee?<br />
</p></div>

<hr style="width: 35%;" />

<div class="poem"><p>
Cursed thy harvest, cursed thy land,<br />
Hunger-stung thy skill'd right hand."<br />
</p></div>

<p>Thomas Hughes became a convert to the Liberal movement,
which shortly after succeeded in repealing a tariff
that had been the cause of such wide-spread misery.
From that day his sympathies have always been with
those classes who are called to earn the least and endure
the most; and when in 1848 he was admitted to the bar
at Lincoln's Inn, London, he had got the name of being
a radical and a reformer in politics&mdash;a name, then, rather
more dreadful to steady-going, conservative English country
gentlemen of the "Squire Brown" type than that of
mad dog.</p>

<p>But long before this the young man had got over his
dread of opprobrious names, and his fear of those who
have nothing harder to hurl.</p>

<p>With a few other resolute spirits he set himself to work
to organize those joint-stock industries and business enterprises
which have since developed into the colossal co-operative
stores of London and the cotton mills of Oldham,
representing many millions of capital, the combined
savings of thrifty artisans and other persons of small means.</p>

<p>In all this, Mr. Hughes's avowed object has been "to
make England the best place for workingmen to live in
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg xi]</span>
that the sun ever shone upon." Whether that can be
done or not in this age of the world is certainly open to
question, but it is equally certain that there can be no possible
harm in making the attempt. That the workingmen
have appreciated the effort is evident from the fact that
they elected Mr. Hughes to Parliament in 1865. It is
said that ordinarily the expense of getting into the House
of Commons&mdash;an unpaid body&mdash;averages about $75,000,
which the candidate or his friends must be prepared to
spend. But in Lambeth, a district of London, inhabited
almost wholly by poor men, two hundred of Mr. Hughes's
admirers came forward and worked night and day without
receiving a single shilling of any man's money, solely
with the determination of seeing their candidate succeed.</p>

<p>Since then, the writer of "Tom Brown's School Days"
would certainly have broken down from overwork if he
had not been, as he says, an "Angular Saxon" and a
muscular Christian as well. During his nine years' pull
in the political harness he earned the double honor of
helping forward the cause of the people and at the same
time he so won the regard of the Crown that he received
the appointment of Queen's Counsel. While member of
Parliament Mr. Hughes was likewise carrying on a large
and lucrative law practice, acting as president of the
Workingmen's College, which he was instrumental in
founding; serving as referee in disputes between manufacturers
and their employees in such a way as to get the
respect and good-will of both; serving also as director in
co-operative banks, coal mines, cotton mills, machine shops,
grocery stores, land and building associations; besides
being chief manager of the Crystal Palace company, and
colonel in a volunteer rifle corps.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg xii]</span>
Yet well known as Mr. Hughes is for his manifold political
and philanthropic services, he is still better known by
his books. Though with him literature has been rather a
recreation than a vocation, yet his fame seems destined to
rest on it, and especially on his "Tom Brown," which has
been pronounced "the best description of public school
life that ever has been, or is ever likely to be, written."
This famous work, published in 1858, was followed the
next year by "The Scouring of the White Horse," a story
of his favorite White Horse Hill. Three years later came
"Tom Brown at Oxford," then "The Life of Alfred the
Great," and lastly his "Memoirs of a Brother" and his
"Manliness of Christ," besides scores, if not hundreds, of
magazine and review articles and letters to London and
American papers.</p>

<p>In 1870 Mr. Hughes made the tour of this country,
receiving such a welcome from his many friends as "Tom
Brown" was sure to get from both old and young. Ten
years afterward he undertook to establish an English
colony in the Cumberland Mountains of East Tennessee.
It was called Rugby, and it was founded in the hope that
it might be useful to many educated young men of good
families who could find no opening worthy of their powers
at home. As he said, "Of the many sad sights in England
there is none sadder than this, of first-rate human
material going helplessly to waste, and in too many cases
beginning to sour and taint, instead of strengthening the
national life." A hundred years before, Franklin had expressed
the same conviction in his pithy maxim, "'Tis hard
for an empty bag to stand upright." It was to fill these
vacant lives with honest work and its rewards that Thomas
Hughes started his emigration to the wilds of Tennessee.
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg xiii]</span>
There, co-operation was to be tried in farming, cattle-raising,
lumbering, and trade, thus saving the community of
workers from that "infinite terror of not making money,"
which Carlyle declared was the only thing that now stirred
deep fear in the souls of his countrymen. Many an ardent
young man fresh from the old Rugby of "Tom Brown"
fame fondly hoped that the new, western Rugby might
enable him to say with Tennyson's "Northern Farmer,"
as he listened to the music of his horse's hoofs on the
road home from market,&mdash;</p>

<div class="pblockquot"><p>
"Proputty, proputty, proputty,&mdash;that's what I 'ears 'em sa&auml;y";<br />
</p></div>

<p>but, unfortunately, the "proputty" will not always come
even at the bidding of hard work and active brains. The
Tennessee enterprise has not commanded success, though
doubtless, as Addison would say, it has done better&mdash;it
has deserved it.</p>

<p>Since the inauguration of the movement Mr. Hughes
has been appointed county judge of Cheshire, and now
makes his home in the quaint old town of Chester, the
county seat. He is verging on the limit of that threescore
and ten which the Psalmist allotted as the measure
of human life. Few men in our day can look back over
a busier or more fruitful career. The awkward and timid
boy has shown the world what rare force of self-conquest,
of persevering growth, of grappling with difficulties, and
of successful achievement was to come out of that unpromising
beginning. Because of this, we are all debtors
to the author of "Tom Brown"; not only for his books,
but still more because we see that these books are the
frank expression of a brave, earnest, and untiring spirit.</p>

<p>The Browns have become illustrious by the pen of

at the universities. Notwithstanding the well-merited but
late fame which has now fallen upon them, any one at all
acquainted with the family must feel that much has yet
to be written and said before the British nation will be
properly sensible of how much of its greatness it owes to
the Browns. For centuries, in their quiet, dogged, homespun
way, they have been subduing the earth in most
English counties, and leaving their mark in American
forests and Australian uplands. Wherever the fleets and

and bayonet, under Rodney<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and St. Vincent, Wolfe and
Moore, Nelson and Wellington, they have carried their
lives in their hands; getting hard knocks and hard work
in plenty, which was, on the whole, what they looked for,
and the best thing for them; and little praise or pudding,
which indeed they, and most of us, are better without.
Talbots<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and Stanleys, St. Maurs, and such-like folk have
led armies and made laws time out of mind; but those
noble families would be somewhat astounded&mdash;if the accounts
ever came to be fairly taken&mdash;to find how small
their work for England has been by the side of that of the
Browns.</p>

<p>These latter, indeed, have until the present generation
rarely been sung by poet, or chronicled by sage. They
have wanted their "sacer vates,"<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> having been too solid to
rise to the top by themselves, and not having been largely
gifted with the talent of catching hold of, and holding on
tight to, whatever good things happened to be going&mdash;the
foundation of the fortunes of so many noble families.
But the world goes on its way, and the wheel turns, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
the wrongs of the Browns, like other wrongs, seem in a
fair way to get righted. And this present writer, having
for many years of his life been a devout Brown-worshipper,
and moreover having the honor of being nearly connected
with an eminently respectable branch of the great Brown
family, is anxious, so far as in him lies, to help the wheel
over, and throw his stone<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> on to the pile.</p>

<h4>THE BROWN CHARACTER.</h4>

<p>However, gentle reader, or simple reader, whichever you
may be, lest you should be led to waste your precious time
upon these pages, I make so bold as at once to tell you
the sort of folk you'll have to meet and put up with, if
you and I are to jog on comfortably together. You shall
hear at once what sort of folk the Browns are, at least my
branch of them; and then if you don't like the sort, why
cut the concern at once, and let you and I cry quits before
either of us can grumble at the other. In the first place,
the Browns are a fighting family. One may question
their wisdom, or wit, or beauty, but about their fight
there can be no question. Wherever hard knocks of any
kind, visible or invisible, are going, there the Brown who
is nearest must shove in his carcass. And these carcasses
for the most part answer very well to the characteristic
propensity; they are a square-headed and snake-necked
generation, broad in the shoulder, deep in the chest, and
thin in the flank, carrying no lumber. Then for clanship,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
they are as bad as Highlanders; it is amazing the belief
they have in one another. With them there is nothing
like the Browns, to the third and fourth generation.
"Blood is thicker than water," is one of their pet sayings.
They can't be happy unless they are always meeting one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
another. Never was such people for family gatherings,
which, were you a stranger, or sensitive, you might think
had better not have been gathered together. For during
the whole time of their being together they luxuriate in telling
one another their minds on whatever subject turns up;
and their minds are wonderfully antagonistic, and all their
opinions are downright beliefs. Till you've been among
them some time and understand them, you can't think
but that they are quarrelling. Not a bit of it; they love
and respect one another ten times the more after a good
set family arguing bout,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and go back, one to his curacy,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
another to his chambers,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and another to his regiment,
freshened for work, and more than ever convinced that
the Browns are the height of company.</p>

<p>This family training, too, combined with their turn for
combativeness, makes them eminently quixotic.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> They
can't let anything alone which they think going wrong.
They must speak their mind about it, annoying all easy-going
folk; and spend their time and money in having a
tinker at it, however hopeless the job. It is an impossibility
to a Brown to leave the most disreputable lame dog
on the other side of a stile. Most other folk get tired
of such work. The old Browns, with red faces, white
whiskers, and bald heads, go on believing and fighting
to a green old age. They have always a crotchet<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> going,
till the old man with a scythe<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> reaps and garners them
away for troublesome old boys as they are.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>
<p>And the most provoking thing is, that no failures knock
them up, or make them hold their hands, or think you, or
me, or other sane people in the right. Failures slide off
them like July rain off a duck's back feathers. Jem and
his whole family turn out bad, and cheat them one week,
and the next they are doing the same thing for Jack; and
when he goes to the treadmill,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and his wife and children
to the workhouse, they will be on the look-out for Bill to
take his place.</p>

<h4>TOM BROWN'S BIRTHPLACE.</h4>

<p>However, it is time for us to get from the general to the
particular; so, leaving the great army of Browns, who are
scattered over the whole empire on which the sun never
sets, and whose general diffusion I take to be the chief
cause of that empire's stability, let us at once fix our attention
upon the small nest of Browns in which our hero was
hatched, and which dwelt in that portion of the Royal
County of Berks,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> which is called the Vale of White Horse.</p>

<p>Most of you have probably travelled down the Great
Western Railway as far as Swindon. Those of you who
did so with your eyes open have been aware, soon after
leaving the Didcot Station, of a fine range of chalk hills
running parallel with the railway on the left-hand side as
you go down, and distant some two or three miles, more
or less, from the line. The highest point in the range is
the White Horse Hill, which you come in front of just
before you stop at the Shrivenham Station. If you love
English scenery and have a few hours to spare, you can't
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
do better, the next time you pass, than stop at the Farringdon
road or Shrivenham Station, and make your way
to that highest point. And those who care for the vague
old stories that haunt country-sides all about England,
will not, if they are wise, be content with only a few hours'
stay; for, glorious as the view is, the neighborhood is yet
more interesting for its relics of by-gone times. I only
know two English neighborhoods thoroughly, and in each,
within a circle of five miles, there is enough of interest
and beauty to last any reasonable man his life. I believe
this to be the case almost throughout the country, but each
has a special attraction, and none can be richer than the
one I am speaking of and going to introduce you to very
particularly; for on this subject I must be prosy; so those
that don't care for England in detail may skip the chapter.</p>

<h4>THE OLD BOY MOURNETH OVER YOUNG ENGLAND.</h4>

<p>O young England! young England! You who are
born into these racing railroad times, when there's a
Great Exhibition, or some monster sight every year, and
you can get over a couple of thousand miles of ground for
three pound ten,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> in a five weeks' holiday, why don't you
know more of your own birthplaces? You're all in the
ends of the earth it seems to me, as soon as you get your
necks out of the educational collar for midsummer holidays,
long vacations, or what not. Going round Ireland,
with a return ticket, in a fortnight; dropping your copies of
Tennyson on the tops of Swiss mountains; or pulling down
the Danube in Oxford racing-boats. And when you get
home for a quiet fortnight, you turn the steam off, and lie on
your backs in the paternal garden, surrounded by the last
batch of books from Mudie's Library, and half bored to death.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, well! I know it has its good side. You all patter
French more or less, and perhaps German; you have seen
men and cities, no doubt, and have your opinions, such as
they are, about schools of painting, high art, and all that;
have seen the pictures at Dresden<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and the Louvre,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and
know the taste of sauer-kraut.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> All I say is, you don't know
your own lanes and woods and fields. Though you may be
chock-full of science, not one in twenty of you knows where
to find the wood-sorrel, or bee-orchis,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> which grows in the
next wood or on the down<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> three miles off, or what the bog-bean
and wood-sage are good for. And as for the country
legends, the stories of the old gable-ended farm-houses, the
place where the last skirmish was fought in the civil wars,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
where the parish butts<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> stood, where the last highwayman
turned to bay, where the last ghost was laid<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> by the parson,
they're gone out of date altogether.</p>

<p>Now, in my time, when we got home by the old coach,
which put us down at the cross-roads with our boxes, the
first day of the holidays, and had been driven off by the
family coachman, singing "Dulce domum"<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> at the top of
our voices, there we were, fixtures, till black Monday<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
came round. We had to cut out our own amusements
within a walk or a ride of home. And so we got to know
all the country folk, and their ways and songs and stories,
by heart; and went over the fields and woods and hills
again and again, till we made friends of them all. We
were Berkshire, or Gloucestershire, or Yorkshire boys:
and you're young cosmopolites,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> belonging to all counties
and no countries. No doubt it's all right; I dare say it is.
This is the day of large views and glorious humanity, and
all that; but I wish backsword play<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> hadn't gone out in
the Vale of White Horse, and that that confounded Great
Western hadn't carried away Alfred's Hill to make an
embankment.</p>

<h4>VALES IN GENERAL.</h4>

<p>But to return to the said Vale of White Horse, the country
in which the first scenes of this true and interesting
story are laid. As I said, the Great Western now runs
right through it, and it is a land of large rich pastures,
bounded by ox-fences, and covered with fine hedgerow
timber, with here and there a nice little gorse<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> or spinney,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
where abideth poor Charley,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> having no other
cover<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> to which to betake himself for miles and miles,
when pushed out some fine November morning by the Old
Berkshire.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Those who have been there, and well mounted,
only know how he and the staunch little pack who dash
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
after him&mdash;heads high and sterns low, with a breast-high
scent&mdash;can consume the ground at such times. There
being little plow-land, and few woods, the Vale is only an
average sporting country, except for hunting. The villages
are straggling, queer old-fashioned places, the houses being
dropped down without the least regularity, in nooks and
out-of-the-way corners, by the sides of shadowy lanes and
footpaths, each with its patch of garden. They are built
chiefly of good gray-stone and thatched;<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> though I see that
within the last year or two the red brick cottages are multiplying,
for the Vale is beginning to manufacture largely
both bricks and tiles. There are lots of waste ground by
the side of the roads in every village, amounting often to
village greens, where feed the pigs and ganders of the people;
and these roads are old-fashioned, homely roads very
dirty and badly made, and hardly endurable in winter, but
pleasant jog-trot roads, running through the great pasture
lands, dotted here and there with little clumps of thorns,
where the sleek kine are feeding, with no fence on either
side of them, and a gate at the end of each field, which
makes you get out of your gig (if you keep one), and gives
you a chance of looking about you every quarter of a mile.</p>

<p>One of the moralists whom we sat under in our youth&mdash;was
it the great Richard Swiveller,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> or Mr. Stiggins?<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
says, "We are born in a vale, and must take the consequences
of being found in such a situation." These consequences,
I for one am ready to encounter. I pity people
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
who wern't born in a vale. I don't mean a flat country,
but a vale; that is, a flat country bounded by hills. The
having your hill <i>always</i> in view, if you choose to turn
toward him, that's the essence of a vale. There he is forever
in the distance, your friend and companion; you
never lose him as you do in hilly districts.</p>

<h4>THE OLD ROMAN CAMP.</h4>

<p>And then what a hill is the White Horse Hill! There
it stands right above all the rest, nine hundred feet above
the sea, and the boldest, bravest shape for a chalk hill
that you ever saw. Let us go up to the top of him, and
see what is to be found there. Ay, you may well wonder,
and think it odd you never heard of this before; but,
wonder or not as you please, there are hundreds of such
things lying about England, which wiser folk than you
know nothing of, and care nothing for. Yes, it's a
magnificent Roman camp,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> and no mistake, with gates,
and ditch, and mounds, all as complete as it was twenty
years after the strong old rogues left it. Here, right up
on the highest point, from which they say you can see
eleven counties, they trenched round all the table-land,
some twelve or fourteen acres, as was their custom, for
they couldn't bear anybody to overlook them, and made
their eyrie.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> The ground falls away rapidly on all sides.
Was there ever such turf in the whole world? You sink
up to your ankles at every step, and yet the spring of it
is delicious. There is always a breeze in the "camp," as
it is called and here it lies just as the Romans left it,
except that cairn,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> on the east side, left by her majesty's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
corps of sappers and miners<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> the other day, when they and
the engineer officer had finished their sojourn there, and
their surveys for the Ordnance Map<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> of Berkshire. It is
altogether a place that you won't forget&mdash;a place to open
a man's soul and make him prophesy, as he looks down
on that great vale spread out as the garden of the Lord
before him, and wave on wave of the mysterious downs
behind; and to the right and left the chalk hills running
away into the distance, along which he can trace for miles
the old Roman road, "the Ridgeway" ("the Rudge" as
the country folk call it), keeping straight along the highest
back of the hills; such a place as Balak<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> brought
Balaam to, and told him to prophesy against the people
in the valley beneath. And he could not, neither shall
you, for they are a people of the Lord who abide there.</p>

<h4>BATTLE OF ASHDOWN.</h4>

<p>And now we leave the camp, and descend toward the
west, and are on the Ashdown. We are treading on heroes.
It is sacred ground for Englishmen, more sacred than all
but one or two fields where their bones lie whitening. For
this is the actual place where our Alfred<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> won his great
battle, the battle of Ashdown "&AElig;scendum" in the
chroniclers), which broke the Danish power, and made
England a Christian land. The Danes held the camp and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
the slope where we are standing&mdash;the whole crown of the
hill, in fact. "The heathen had beforehand seized the
higher ground," as old Asser<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> says, having wasted everything
behind them from London, and being just ready
to burst down on the fair vale, Alfred's own birthplace
and heritage. And up the heights came the Saxons,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> as
they did at the Alma.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> "The Christians led up their line
from the lower ground. There stood also on that same
spot a single thorn-tree, marvellous stumpy (which we
ourselves with our very own eyes have seen)." Bless the
old chronicler!<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> does he think nobody ever saw the
"single thorn-tree" but himself? Why, there it stands to
this very day, just on the edge of the slope, and I saw it
not three weeks since; an old single thorn-tree, "marvellous
stumpy." At least, if it isn't the same tree, it ought
to have been, for it's just in the place where the battle
must have been won or lost&mdash;"around which, as I was
saying, the two lines of foemen came together in battle
with a huge shout. And in this place one of the two
kings of the heathen and five of his earls fell down and
died, and many thousands of the heathen side in the same
place." After which crowning mercy, the pious king,
that there might never be wanting a sign and a memorial
to the country-side, carved out on the northern side of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
chalk hill under the camp, where it is almost precipitous,
the great Saxon white horse, which he who will may see
from the railway, and which gives its name to the vale
over which it has looked these thousand years and more.</p>

<p>Right down below the White Horse is a curious deep
and broad gully called "the Manger," into one side of
which the hills fall with a series of the most lovely sweeping
curves, known as the "Giant's Stairs"; they are not
a bit like stairs, but I never saw anything like them anywhere
else, with their short green turf, and tender bluebells,
and gossamer and thistle-down gleaming in the sun,
and the sheep-paths running along their sides like ruled
lines.</p>

<p>The other side of the Manger is formed by the Dragon's
Hill, a curious little round self-confident fellow, thrown
forward from the range, and utterly unlike everything
round him. On this hill some deliverer of mankind&mdash;St.
George<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> the country folk used to tell me&mdash;killed a
dragon. Whether it were St. George, I cannot say; but
surely a dragon was killed there, for you may see the
marks yet where his blood ran down, and more by token<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
the place where it ran down is the easiest way up the hill-side.</p>

<p>Passing along the Ridgeway to the west for about a
mile, we come to a little clump of young beech and firs,
with a growth of thorn and privet<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> underwood. Here you
may find nests of the strong down-partridge and pewit,
but take care that the keeper<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> isn't down upon you; and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
in the middle of it is an old cromlech,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> a huge flat stone
raised on seven or eight others, and led up to by a path,
with large single stones set up on each side. This is
Wayland Smith's cave,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> a place of classic fame now; but
as Sir Walter<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> has touched it, I may as well let it alone,
and refer you to Kenilworth for the legend.</p>

<p>The thick deep wood which you see in the hollow, about
a mile off, surrounds Ashdown Park, built by Inigo Jones.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
Four broad alleys are cut through the wood, from circumference
to centre, and each leads to one face of the house.
The mystery of the downs hangs about house and wood,
as they stand there alone, so unlike all around, with the
green slopes, studded with great stones just about this
part, stretching away on all sides. It was a wise Lord
Craven,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> I think, who pitched his tent there.</p>

<h4>THE "SEVEN BARROWS" FARM.</h4>

<p>Passing along the Ridgeway to the east, we soon come
to cultivated land. The downs, strictly so called, are no
more; Lincolnshire farmers have been imported, and the
long fresh slopes are sheep-walks<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> no more, but grow famous
turnips and barley. One of these improvers lives over
there at the "Seven Barrows"<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> farm, another mystery of
the great downs. There are the barrows still, solemn and
silent, like ships in the calm sea, the sepulchres of some
sons of men. But of whom? It is three miles from the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
White Horse, too far for the slain of Ashdown to be buried
there&mdash;who shall say what heroes are waiting there?
But we must get down into the Vale again, and so away by
the Great Western Railway to town, for time and the printer's
devil press; and it is a terrible long and slippery
descent, and a shocking bad road. At the bottom, however,
there is a pleasant public,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> whereat we must really
take a modest quencher, for the down air is provocative of
thirst. So we pull up under an old oak which stands
before the door.</p>

<h4>THE BLOWING STONE.</h4>

<p>"What is the name of your hill, landlord?"</p>

<p>"Blawing <span class="smcap">Stwun</span> Hill, sir, to be sure."</p>

<div class="pblockquot">
<p>[<span class="smcap">Reader.</span> "<i>Sturm?</i>"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Author.</span> "<i>Stone</i>, stupid; The Blowing <i>Stone</i>."]</p>
</div>

<p>"And of your house? I can't make out the sign."</p>

<p>"Blawing <span class="smcap">Stwun</span>, sir," says the landlord, pouring out
his old ale from a Toby Philpot jug,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> with a melodious
crash, into the long-necked glass.</p>

<p>"What queer names!" say we, sighing at the end of
our draught, and holding out the glass to be replenished.</p>

<p>"Bean't queer at all, as I can see, sir," says mine host,
handing back our glass, "seeing that this here is the
Blawing Stwun itself"; putting his hand on a square
lump of stone, some three feet and a half high, perforated
with two or three queer holes, like petrified antediluvian<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
rat-holes, which lies there close under the oak, under our
very nose. We are more than ever puzzled, and drink
our second glass of ale, wondering what will come next.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
"Like to hear un,<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> sir?" says mine host, setting down
Toby Philpot on the tray, and resting both hands on the
"Stwun." We are ready for anything; and he, without
waiting for a reply, applies his mouth to one of the rat-holes.
Something must come of it, if he doesn't burst.
Good heavens! I hope he has no apoplectic tendencies.
Yes, here it comes, sure enough, a grewsome<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> sound between
a moan and a roar, and spreads itself away over the
valley, and up the hill-side, and into the woods at the
back of the house, a ghost-like awful voice. "Um<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> do
say, sir," says mine host, rising, purple-faced, while the
moan is still coming out of the Stwun, "as they used in
old times to warn the country-side, by blawing the Stwun
when the enemy was a comin'&mdash;and as how folks could
make un heered then for seven mile round; leastways, so
I've heerd lawyer Smith say, and he knows a smart sight
about them old times." We can hardly swallow lawyer
Smith's seven miles, but could the blowing of the stone
have been a summons, a sort of sending the fiery cross<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
round the neighborhood in the old times? What old
times? Who knows? We pay for our beer, and are
thankful.</p>

<p>"And what's the name of the village just below, landlord?"</p>

<p>"Kingstone Lisle, sir."</p>

<p>"Fine plantations<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> you've got here."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
"Yes, sir, the Squire's<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> 'mazin' fond of trees and such
like."</p>

<p>"No wonder. He's got some real beauties to be fond
of. Good-day, landlord."</p>

<p>"Good-day, sir, and a pleasant ride to 'e."<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<h4>FARRINGDON AND PUSEY.</h4>

<p>And now, my boys, you whom I want to get for readers,
have you had enough? Will you give in at once, and say
you're convinced, and let me begin my story or will you
have some more of it? Remember, I've only been over a
little bit of the hill-side yet, what you could ride round
easily on your ponies in an hour. I'm only just come
down into the vale, by Blowing Stone Hill, and if I once
begin about the vale, what's to stop me? You'll have to
hear all about Wantage, the birthplace of Alfred, and
Farringdon, which held out so long for Charles I. (the
vale was near Oxford, and dreadfully malignant;<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> full of
Throgmortons, Puseys, and Pyes, and such like, and their
brawny retainers). Did you ever read Thomas Ingoldsby's
"Legend of Hamilton Tighe"?<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> If you haven't, you
ought to have. Well, Farringdon is where he lived,
before he went to sea; his real name was Hampden Pye,
and the Pyes were the great folk at Farringdon. Then
there's Pusey. You've heard of the Pusey horn,<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
King Canute gave to the Puseys of that day, and which
the gallant old squire, lately gone to his rest (whom
Berkshire freeholders<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> turned out of last Parliament, to
their eternal disgrace, for voting according to his conscience),
used to bring out on high days, holidays, and
bonfire nights. And the splendid old Cross church at
Uffington, the Uffingas town; how the whole country-side
teems with Saxon names and memories! And the old
moated grange<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> at Compton, nestled close under the hill-side,
where twenty Marianas<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> may have lived, with its
bright water-lilies in the moat, and its yew walk "the
cloister walk," and its peerless terraced gardens. There
they all are, and twenty things besides, for those who care
about them, and have eyes. And these are the sort of
things you may find, I believe, every one of you, in any
common English country neighborhood.</p>

<p>Will you look for them under your own noses, or will
you not? Well, well, I've done what I can to make you,
and if you will go gadding over half Europe now every
holiday, I can't help it. I was born and bred a west-countryman,<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
thank God! a Wessex man, a citizen of the
noblest Saxon kingdom of Wessex, a regular "Angular
Saxon,"<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> the very soul of me "adscriptus gleb&aelig;."<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> There's
nothing like the old country-side for me, and no music
like the twang of the real old Saxon tongue, as one gets
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
it fresh from the veritable chaw<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> in the White Horse Vale;

<h4>SQUIRE BROWN AND HIS HOUSEHOLD.</h4>

<p>Here at any rate lived and stopped at home Squire
Brown, J. P.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> for the county of Berks, in a village near
the foot of the White Horse range. And here he dealt
out justice and mercy in a rough way, and brought up
sons and daughters, and hunted the fox, and grumbled
at the badness of the roads and the times. And his
wife dealt out stockings, and calico<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> shirts, and smock
frocks,<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> and comforting drinks to the old folks with the
"rheumatiz," and good counsel to all; and kept the coal
and clothes clubs going, for Yule-tide,<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> when the bands of
mummers<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> came round dressed out in ribbons and colored
paper caps, and stamped round the Squire's kitchen, repeating
in true sing-song vernacular<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> the legend of St. George
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
and his fight, and the ten-pound doctor,<a name="FNanchor_93_94" id="FNanchor_93_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_94" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> who
plays his part at healing the Saint&mdash;a relic, I believe, of
the old middle-age mysteries.<a name="FNanchor_94_95" id="FNanchor_94_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_95" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> It was the first dramatic
representation which greeted the eyes of little Tom, who
was brought down into the kitchen by his nurse to witness
it, at the mature age of three years. Tom was the eldest
child of his parents, and from his earliest babyhood exhibited
the family characteristics in great strength. He was
a hearty, strong boy from the first, given to fighting with
and escaping from his nurse, and fraternizing with all the
village boys, with whom he made expeditions all round
the neighborhood. And here in the quiet, old-fashioned
country village, under the shadow of the everlasting hills,
Tom Brown was reared, and never left it till he went first
to school when nearly eight years of age, for in those
days change of air twice a year was not thought absolutely
necessary for the health of all her majesty's lieges.<a name="FNanchor_95_96" id="FNanchor_95_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_96" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<h4>THE OLD BOY ABUSETH MOVING ON.</h4>

<p>I have been credibly informed, and am inclined to believe,
that the various Boards of Directors of Railway
Companies, those gigantic jobbers<a name="FNanchor_96_97" id="FNanchor_96_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_97" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> and bribers, while
quarrelling about everything else, agreed together some ten
years back to buy up the learned profession of medicine,
body and soul. To this end they set apart several millions
of money, which they continually distribute judiciously
among the doctors, stipulating only this one thing, that
they shall prescribe change of air to every patient who can
pay, or borrow money to pay, a railway fare, and see their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
prescription carried out. If it be not for this, why is it
that none of us can be well at home for a year together?
It wasn't so twenty years ago,&mdash;not a bit of it. The
Browns didn't go out of the county once in five years. A
visit to Reading or Abingdon twice a year, at Assizes or
Quarter Sessions<a name="FNanchor_97_98" id="FNanchor_97_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_98" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> which the Squire made on his horse,
with a pair of saddle-bags containing his wardrobe&mdash;a
stay of a day or two at some country neighbor's&mdash;or an
expedition to a county ball or the yeomanry review&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_98_99" id="FNanchor_98_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_99" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> made
up the sum of the Brown locomotion in most years.
A stray Brown from some distant county dropped in every
now and then; or from Oxford, on grave nag, an old
don<a name="FNanchor_99_100" id="FNanchor_99_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_100" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> contemporary of the Squire; and were looked upon
by the Brown household and the villagers with the same
sort of feeling with which we now regard a man who has
crossed the Rocky Mountains, or launched a boat on the
great lake in Central Africa. The White Horse Vale, remember,
was traversed by no great road; nothing but
country parish roads, and these very bad. Only one coach
ran there, and this one only from Wantage to London, so
that the western part of the vale was without regular means
of moving on, and certainly didn't seem to want them.
There was the canal, by the way, which supplied the
country-side with coal, and up and down which continually
went the long barges with the big black men lounging by
the side of the horses along the towing-path, and the
women in bright-colored handkerchiefs standing in the
sterns steering. Standing, I say, but you could never see
whether they were standing or sitting, all but their heads
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
and shoulders being out of sight in the cozy little cabins
which occupied some eight feet of the stern and which
Tom Brown pictured to himself as the most desirable of
residences. His nurse told him that those good-natured-looking
women were in the constant habit of enticing
children into the barges and taking them up to London
and selling them, which Tom wouldn't believe, and which
made him resolve as soon as possible to accept the oft-proffered
invitation of these sirens<a name="FNanchor_100_101" id="FNanchor_100_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_101" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> to "young master," to
come in and have a ride. But as yet the nurse was too
much for Tom.</p>

<h4>THE OLD BOY APPROVETH MOVING ON.</h4>

<p>Yet why should I, after all, abuse the gadabout propensities
of my countrymen? We are a vagabond nation now,
that's certain, for better, for worse. I am a vagabond; I
have been away from home no less than five distinct times
in the last year. The Queen sets us the example&mdash;we are
moving on from top to bottom. Little dirty Jack, who
abides in Clement's Inn<a name="FNanchor_101_102" id="FNanchor_101_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_102" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> gateway, and blacks my boots for
a penny, takes his month's hop-picking<a name="FNanchor_102_103" id="FNanchor_102_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_103" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> every year as a
matter of course. Why shouldn't he? I am delighted at
it. I love vagabonds, only I prefer poor to rich ones;-couriers<a name="FNanchor_103_104" id="FNanchor_103_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_104" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
and ladies' maids, imperials<a name="FNanchor_104_105" id="FNanchor_104_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_105" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> and travelling carriages
are an abomination unto me&mdash;I cannot away with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
them. But for dirty Jack, and every good fellow who, in
the words of the capital French song, moves about,</p>

<div class="poem"><p>
"Comme le lima&ccedil;on,<br />
Portant tout son bagage,<br />
Ses meubles, sa maison,"<a name="FNanchor_105_106" id="FNanchor_105_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_106" class="fnanchor">[105]</a><br />
</p></div>

<p>on his own back, why, good luck to them, and many a
merry road-side adventure, and steaming supper in the
chimney-corners of road-side inns, Swiss ch&acirc;lets,<a name="FNanchor_106_107" id="FNanchor_106_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_107" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> Hottentot
kraals,<a name="FNanchor_107_108" id="FNanchor_107_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_108" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> or wherever else they like to go. So having
succeeded in contradicting myself in my first chapter
(which gives me great hopes that you will all go on, and
think me a good fellow, notwithstanding my crotchets), I
shall here shut up for the present, and consider my ways;
having resolved to "sar' it out,"<a name="FNanchor_108_109" id="FNanchor_108_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_109" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> as we say in the Vale,
"holus bolus,"<a name="FNanchor_109_110" id="FNanchor_109_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_110" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> just as it comes, and then you'll probably
get the truth out of me.</p>

was a good-hearted, tearful, scatter-brain<a name="FNanchor_5_115" id="FNanchor_5_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_115" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> girl,
lately taken by Tom's mother, Madam Brown, as she was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
called, from the village school to be trained as nursery-maid.
Madam Brown was a rare trainer of servants, and
spent herself freely in the profession; for profession it was,
and gave her more trouble by half than many people take
to earn a good income. Her servants were known and
sought after for miles round. Almost all the girls who
attained a certain place in the village school were taken by
her, one or two at a time, as house-maids, laundry-maids,
nursery-maids, or kitchen-maids, and, after a year or two's
drilling, were started in life amongst the neighboring
families, with good principles and wardrobes. One of the
results of this system was the perpetual despair of Mrs.
Brown's cook and own maid, who no sooner had a notable<a name="FNanchor_6_116" id="FNanchor_6_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_116" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
girl made to their hands, than missus was sure to find a
good place for her and send her off, taking in fresh importations
from the school. Another was, that the house
was always full of young girls with clean, shining faces;
who broke plates and scorched linen, but made an atmosphere
of cheerful homely life about the place, good for
every one who came within its influence. Mrs. Brown
loved young people, and in fact human creatures in general,
above plates and linen. They were more like a lot of
elder children than servants, and felt to her more as a
mother or aunt than as a mistress.</p>

<p>Tom's nurse was one who took in her instruction very
slowly,&mdash;she seemed to have two left hands and no head;
and so Mrs. Brown kept her on longer than usual that she
might expend her awkwardness and forgetfulness upon
those who would not judge and punish her too strictly for
them.</p>

<p>Charity Lamb was her name. It had been the immemorial
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
habit of the village to christen children either by
Bible names, or by those of the cardinal<a name="FNanchor_7_117" id="FNanchor_7_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_117" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and other virtues;
so that one was forever hearing in the village street,
or on the green, shrill sounds of "Prudence! Prudence!
thee cum' out o' the gutter"; or "Mercy! drat<a name="FNanchor_8_118" id="FNanchor_8_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_118" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> the girl,
what bist<a name="FNanchor_9_119" id="FNanchor_9_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_119" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> thee a doin' wi' little Faith?" and there were
Ruths, Rachels, Keziahs, in every corner. The same with
the boys; they were Benjamins, Jacobs, Noahs, Enochs. I
suppose the custom has come down from puritan<a name="FNanchor_10_120" id="FNanchor_10_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_120" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> times&mdash;there
it is, at any rate, very strong still in the Vale.</p>

<h4>TOM BROWN'S FIRST REBELLION.</h4>

<p>Well, from early morn till dewy eve, when she had it
out of him in the cold tub before putting him to bed,
Charity and Tom were pitted against one another. Physical
power was as yet on the side of Charity, but she
hadn't a chance with him wherever head-work was wanted.
This war of independence began every morning before
breakfast, when Charity escorted her charge to a neighboring
farm-house which supplied the Browns, and where
by his mother's wish, Master Tom went to drink whey,<a name="FNanchor_11_121" id="FNanchor_11_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_121" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
before breakfast. Tom had no sort of objection to whey,
but he had a decided liking for curds, which were forbidden
as unwholesome, and there was seldom a morning
that he did not manage to secure a handful of hard curds,
in defiance of Charity and the farmer's wife. The latter
good soul was a gaunt angular woman, who, with an old
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
black bonnet on the top of her head, the strings dangling
about her shoulders, and her gown tucked through her
pocket holes, went clattering about the dairy, cheese-room,
and yard, in high pattens.<a name="FNanchor_12_122" id="FNanchor_12_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_122" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Charity was some sort of
niece of the old lady's, and was consequently free of the
farm-house and garden, into which she could not resist
going for the purposes of gossip and flirtation with the
heir-apparent,<a name="FNanchor_13_123" id="FNanchor_13_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_123" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> who was a dawdling fellow, never out at
work as he ought to have been. The moment Charity had
found her cousin, or any other occupation, Tom would
slip away; and in a minute shrill cries would be heard
from the dairy: "Charity, Charity, thee lazy huzzy, where
bist?" and Tom would break cover,<a name="FNanchor_14_124" id="FNanchor_14_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_124" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> hands and mouth
full of curds, and take refuge on the shaky surface of the
great muck reservoir in the middle of the yard, disturbing
the repose of the great pigs. Here he was in safety, as no
grown person could follow without getting over his knees;
and the luckless Charity, while her aunt scolded her from
the dairy-door, for being "allus hankering about arter our
Willum, instead of minding Master Tom," would descend
from threats to coaxing, to lure Tom out of the muck,
which was rising over his shoes and would soon tell a
tale on his stockings for which she would be sure to catch
it from missus's maid.</p>

<h4>TOM BROWN'S ABETTORS&mdash;NOAH.</h4>

<p>Tom had two abettors in the shape of a couple of old
boys, Noah and Benjamin by name, who defended him
from Charity, and expended much time upon his education.
They were both of them retired servants of former
generations of the Browns. Noah Crooke was a keen, dry
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
old man of almost ninety, but still able to totter about.
He talked to Tom quite as if he were one of his own family,
and indeed had long completely identified the Browns
with himself. In some remote age he had been the attendant
of a Miss Brown, and had conveyed her about the
country on a pillion.<a name="FNanchor_15_125" id="FNanchor_15_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_125" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> He had a little round picture of the
identical gray horse caparisoned with the identical pillion,
before which he used to do a sort of fetish<a name="FNanchor_16_126" id="FNanchor_16_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_126" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> worship
and abuse turnpike roads and carriages. He wore an old
full-bottomed wig,<a name="FNanchor_17_127" id="FNanchor_17_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_127" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> the gift of some dandy old Brown
whom he had valeted<a name="FNanchor_18_128" id="FNanchor_18_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_128" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> in the middle of last century, which
habiliment Master Tom looked upon with considerable
respect, not to say fear; and indeed his whole feeling
toward Noah was strongly tainted with awe; and when
the old gentleman was gathered to his fathers, Tom's
lamentation over him was not unaccompanied by a certain
joy at having seen the last of the wig: "Poor old Noah,
dead and gone," said he, "Tom Brown so sorry! Put him
in the coffin, wig and all!"</p>

<h4>TOM BROWN'S ABETTORS&mdash;BENJY.</h4>

<p>But old Benjy was young master's real delight and refuge.
He was a youth by the side of Noah, scarce seventy
years old. A cheery, humorous, kind-hearted old man,
full of sixty years of Vale gossip, and of all sorts of helpful
ways for young and old, but above all for children. It
was he who bent the first pin with which Tom extricated
his first stickleback<a name="FNanchor_19_129" id="FNanchor_19_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_129" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> out of "Pebbly Brook," the little
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
stream which ran through the village. The first stickleback
was a splendid fellow, with fabulous red and blue
gills. Tom kept him in a small basin till the day of his
death, and became a fisherman from that day. Within a
month from the taking of the first stickleback, Benjy had
carried off our hero to the canal, in defiance of Charity;
and between them, after a whole afternoon's pop-joying,<a name="FNanchor_20_130" id="FNanchor_20_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_130" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
they had caught three or four coarse fish and a perch,
averaging perhaps two and a half ounces each, which Tom
bore home in rapture to his mother as a precious gift, and
which she received like a true mother with equal rapture,
instructing the cook nevertheless, in a private interview,
not to prepare the same for the squire's dinner. Charity
had appealed against old Benjy in the meantime, representing
the dangers of the canal banks; but Mrs. Brown,
seeing the boy's inaptitude for female guidance, had decided
in Benjy's favor, and from thenceforth the old man
was Tom's dry nurse. And as they sat by the canal
watching their little green and white float,<a name="FNanchor_21_131" id="FNanchor_21_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_131" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Benjy would
instruct him in the doings of deceased Browns. How his
grandfather, in the early days of the great war, when there
was much distress and crime in the Vale, and the magistrates
had been threatened by the mob, had ridden in with
a big stick in his hand, and held the Petty Sessions<a name="FNanchor_22_132" id="FNanchor_22_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_132" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> by
himself. How his great uncle, the rector, had encountered
and laid the last ghost, who had frightened the old women,
male and female, of the parish, out of their senses, and
who turned out to be the blacksmith's apprentice, disguised
in drink and a white sheet. It was Benjy too who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
saddled Tom's first pony, and instructed him in the mysteries
of horsemanship, teaching him to throw his weight
back and keep his hand low; and who stood chuckling
outside the door of the girls' school when Tom rode his
little Shetland into the cottage and round the table, where
the old dame and her pupils were seated at their work.</p>

<p>Benjy himself was come of a family distinguished in
the Vale for their prowess in all athletic games. Some
half-dozen of his brothers and kinsmen had gone to the
wars, of whom only one had survived to come home, with
a small pension, and three bullets in different parts of his
body; he had shared Benjy's cottage till his death, and
had left him his old dragoon's<a name="FNanchor_23_133" id="FNanchor_23_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_133" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> sword and pistol, which
hung over the mantle-piece, flanked by a pair of heavy
single-sticks, with which Benjy himself had won renown
long ago as an old gamester,<a name="FNanchor_24_134" id="FNanchor_24_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_134" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> against the picked men of
Wiltshire, and Somersetshire,<a name="FNanchor_25_135" id="FNanchor_25_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_135" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> in many a good bout at
the revels and pastimes of the country-side. For he had
been a famous back-sword man in his young days, and a
good wrestler at elbow and collar.</p>

<h4>OUR VEAST.</h4>

<p>Back-swording and wrestling were the most serious
holiday pursuits of the Vale,&mdash;those by which men attained
fame,&mdash;and each village had its champion. I suppose
that, on the whole, people were less worked then,
than they are now; at any rate, they seemed to have
more time and energy for the old pastimes. The great
times for back-swording came round once a year, in each
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
village at the feast. The Vale "veasts" were not the
common statute feasts<a name="FNanchor_26_136" id="FNanchor_26_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_136" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>, but much more ancient business.
They are literally, so far as one can ascertain, feasts of
the dedication, <i>i.e.</i>, they were first established in the
church-yard on the day on which the village church was
opened for public worship, which was on the wake or
festival of the patron saint, and have been held on the
same day in every year since that time.</p>

<p>There was no longer any remembrance of why the
"veast" had been instituted, but nevertheless it had a
pleasant and almost sacred character of its own. For it
was then that all the children of the village, wherever
they were scattered, tried to get home for a holiday to
visit their fathers and mothers and friends, bringing with
them their wages or some little gift from up the country
for the old folk. Perhaps for a day or two before, but at
any rate on "veast-day" and the day after, in our village,
you might see strapping, healthy young men and women
from all parts of the country going round from house to
house in their best clothes, and finishing up with a call
on Madam Brown, whom they would consult as to putting
out their earnings to the best advantage, or how best
to expend the same for the benefit of the old folk. Every
household, however poor, managed to raise a "feast-cake"
and bottle of ginger or raisin wine, which stood on the
cottage table ready for all comers, and not unlikely to
make them remember feast-time,&mdash;for feast-cake is very
solid and full of huge raisins. Moreover feast-time was
the day of reconciliation for the parish. If Job Higgins
and Noah Freeman hadn't spoken for the last six months,
their "old women" would be sure to get it patched up
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
by that day. And though there was a good deal of drinking
and low vice in the booths<a name="FNanchor_27_137" id="FNanchor_27_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_137" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> of an evening, it was
pretty well confined to those who would have been doing
the like "veast or no veast"; and, on the whole, the effect
was humanizing and Christian. In fact, the only reason
why this is not the case still, is that gentlefolk and farmers
have taken to other amusements, and have, as usual, forgotten
the poor. They don't attend the feasts themselves,
and call them disreputable, whereupon the steadiest of
the poor leave them also, and they become what they are
called. Class amusements, be they for dukes or plow-boys,
always become nuisances and curses to a country.
The true charm of cricket<a name="FNanchor_28_138" id="FNanchor_28_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_138" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and hunting is, that they are
still, more or less sociable and universal; there's a place
for every man who will come and take his part.</p>

<h4>APPROACH OF VEAST-DAY.</h4>

<p>No one in the village enjoyed the approach of "veast-day"
more than Tom, in the year in which he was taken
under old Benjy's tutelage.<a name="FNanchor_29_139" id="FNanchor_29_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_139" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> The feast was held in a large
green field at the lower end of the village. The road to
Farringdon ran along one side of it, and the brook by the
side of the road; and above the brook was another large
gentle-sloping pasture-land, with a foot-path running
down it from the church-yard; and the old church, the
originator of all the mirth, towered up with its gray walls
and lancet windows<a name="FNanchor_30_140" id="FNanchor_30_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_140" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> overlooking and sanctioning the
whole, though its own share therein had been forgotten.
At the point where the foot-path crossed the brook and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
road, and entered on the field where the feast was held, was
a long, low, roadside inn, and on the opposite side of the
field was a large, white, thatched farm-house, where dwelt
an old sporting farmer, a great promoter of the revels.</p>

<p>Past the old church, and down the foot-path, pottered<a name="FNanchor_31_141" id="FNanchor_31_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_141" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
the old man and the child, hand in hand, early on the
afternoon of the day before the feast, and wandered all
around the ground which was already being occupied by
the "cheap Jacks,"<a name="FNanchor_32_142" id="FNanchor_32_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_142" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> with their green-covered carts and
marvellous assortment of wares, and the booths of more
legitimate<a name="FNanchor_33_143" id="FNanchor_33_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_143" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> small traders with their tempting arrays of
fairings<a name="FNanchor_34_144" id="FNanchor_34_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_144" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> and eatables; and penny peep-shows and other
shows, containing pink-eyed ladies, and dwarfs, and boa-constrictors,
and wily Indians. But the object of most
interest to Benjy, and of course to his pupil, also, was the
stage of rough planks, some four feet high, which was
being put up by the village carpenter for the back-swording
and wrestling; and after surveying the whole tenderly,
old Benjy led his charge away to the roadside inn, where
he ordered a glass of ale and a long pipe for himself, and
discussed these unwonted luxuries on the bench outside
in the soft autumn evening with mine host, another old
servant of the Browns, and speculated with him on the
likelihood of a good show of old gamesters to contend for
the morrow's prizes, and told tales of the gallant bouts
forty years back, to which Tom listened with all his ears
and eyes.</p>

<h4>MORNING OF THE VEAST.</h4>

<p>But who shall tell the joy of the next morning, when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
the church bells were ringing a merry peal and old Benjy
appeared in the servants' hall, resplendent in a long blue
coat and brass buttons, and a pair of old yellow buckskins<a name="FNanchor_35_145" id="FNanchor_35_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_145" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
and top-boots,<a name="FNanchor_36_146" id="FNanchor_36_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_146" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> which he had cleaned for and inherited
from Tom's grandfather; a stout thorn-stick in
his hand, and a nosegay of pinks and lavender in his button-hole,
and led away Tom in his best clothes, and two
new shillings in his breeches pockets? Those two, at any
rate, look like enjoying the day's revel.</p>

<p>They quicken their pace when they get into the church-yard,
for already they see the field thronged with country
folk, the men in clean white smocks or velveteen or fustian<a name="FNanchor_37_147" id="FNanchor_37_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_147" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
coats, with rough plush waistcoats of many colors,
and the women in the beautiful scarlet cloak, the usual
outdoor dress of West-country women in those days, and
which often descended in families from mother to daughter,
or in new-fashioned stuff<a name="FNanchor_38_148" id="FNanchor_38_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_148" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> shawls, which, if they would
but believe it, don't become them half so well. The air
resounds with the pipe and tabor,<a name="FNanchor_39_149" id="FNanchor_39_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_149" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> and the drums and
trumpets of the showmen shouting at the doors of their
caravans,<a name="FNanchor_40_150" id="FNanchor_40_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_150" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> over which tremendous pictures of the wonders
to be seen within hang temptingly; while through all rises
the shrill "root-too-too-too" of Mr. Punch, and the unceasing
pan-pipe<a name="FNanchor_41_151" id="FNanchor_41_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_151" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> of his satellite.</p>

<p>"Lawk a' massey, Mr. Benjamin," cries a stout motherly
woman in a red cloak as they enter the field, "be that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
you? Well, I never! you do look purely.<a name="FNanchor_42_152" id="FNanchor_42_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_152" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> And how's
the squire, and madam, and the family?"</p>

<p>Benjy graciously shakes hands with the speaker, who
has left our village for some years, but has come over for
"veast-day" on a visit to an old gossip&mdash;and gently indicates
the heir apparent of the Browns.</p>

<p>"Bless his little heart! I must gi' un a kiss. Here,
Susannah, Susannah!" cries she, raising herself from the
embrace, "come and see Mr. Benjamin and young Master
Tom. You minds<a name="FNanchor_43_153" id="FNanchor_43_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_153" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> our Sukey, Mr. Benjamin? she be
growed a rare slip of a wench<a name="FNanchor_44_154" id="FNanchor_44_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_154" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> since you seen her, tho'
her'll be sixteen come Martinmas<a name="FNanchor_45_155" id="FNanchor_45_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_155" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>. I do aim<a name="FNanchor_46_156" id="FNanchor_46_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_156" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> to take
her to see madam to get her a place."</p>

<p>And Sukey comes bouncing away from a knot of old
school-fellows, and drops a courtesy to Mr. Benjamin.
And elders come up from all parts to salute Benjy, and
girls who have been madam's pupils to kiss Master Tom.
And they carry him off to load him with fairings; and he
returns to Benjy, his hat and coat covered with ribbons,
and his pockets crammed with wonderful boxes, which
open upon ever new boxes and boxes, and popguns and
trumpets, and apples, and gilt gingerbread from the stall
of Angel Heavens, sole vender thereof, whose booth groans
with kings and queens, and elephants, and prancing steeds,
all gleaming with gold. There was more gold on Angel's
cakes than there is ginger in those of this degenerate
age. Skilled diggers might yet make a fortune in the
church-yards of the Vale by carefully washing the dust
of the consumers of Angel's gingerbread. Alas! he is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
with his namesakes, and his receipts have, I fear, died
with him.</p>

<h4>THE JINGLING MATCH.</h4>

<p>And then they inspect the penny peep-show, at least
Tom does, while old Benjy stands outside and gossips,
and walks up the steps, and enters the mysterious doors
of the pink-eyed lady and the Irish Giant, who do not by
any means come up to their pictures; and the boa will
not swallow his rabbit, but there the rabbit is waiting to
be swallowed,&mdash;and what can you expect for tuppence?<a name="FNanchor_47_157" id="FNanchor_47_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_157" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
We are easily pleased in the Vale. Now there is a rush
of the crowd, and a tinkling bell is heard, and shouts of
laughter; and Master Tom mounts on Benjy's shoulders,
and beholds a jingling match in all its glory. The games
are begun, and this is the opening of them. It is a
quaint<a name="FNanchor_48_158" id="FNanchor_48_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_158" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> game, immensely amusing to look at; and as I
don't know whether it is used in your counties, I had
better describe it. A large roped ring is made, into
which are introduced a dozen or so of big boys and young
men who mean to play; these are carefully blinded and
turned loose into the ring, and then a man is introduced
not blind-folded, with a bell hung round his neck, and
his two hands tied behind him. Of course, every time
he moves, the bell must ring, as he has no hand to hold it,
and so the dozen blind-folded men have to catch him.
This they cannot always manage if he is a lively fellow,
but half of them always rush into the arms of the other
half, or drive their heads together, or tumble over; and
then the crowd laughs vehemently, and invents nicknames
for them on the spur of the moment, and they, if
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
they be choleric, tear off the handkerchiefs which blind
them, and not unfrequently pitch into one another, each
thinking that the other must have run against him on
purpose. It is great fun to look at a jingling match certainly,
and Tom shouts and jumps on old Benjy's shoulders
at the sight, until the old man feels weary, and shifts
him to the strong young shoulders of the groom, who has
just got down to the fun.</p>

<p>And now, while they are climbing the pole in another
part of the field, and muzzling in a flour-tub<a name="FNanchor_49_159" id="FNanchor_49_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_159" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> in another,
the old farmer whose house, as has been said, overlooks
the field, and who is master of the revels, gets up the
steps on to the stage, and announces to all whom it may
concern that a half-sovereign<a name="FNanchor_50_160" id="FNanchor_50_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_160" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> in money will be forthcoming
for the old gamester who breaks most heads; to which
the squire and he have added a new hat.</p>

<p>The amount of the prize is sufficient to stimulate the
men of the immediate neighborhood, but not enough to
bring any very high talent from a distance; so, after a
glance or two round, a tall fellow, who is a down shepherd,<a name="FNanchor_51_161" id="FNanchor_51_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_161" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
chucks his hat on to the stage and climbs up the
steps, looking rather sheepish. The crowd, of course, first
cheer, then chaff<a name="FNanchor_52_162" id="FNanchor_52_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_162" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> as usual, as he picks up his hat and
begins handling the sticks to see which will suit him.</p>

<h4>THE BACK-SWORDING.</h4>

<p>"Wooy,<a name="FNanchor_53_163" id="FNanchor_53_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_163" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Willum Smith, thee canst plaay wi' he<a name="FNanchor_54_164" id="FNanchor_54_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_164" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> arra<a name="FNanchor_55_165" id="FNanchor_55_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_165" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
daay," says his companion to the blacksmith's apprentice,
a stout young fellow of nineteen or twenty. Willum's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
sweetheart is in the "veast" somewhere, and has strictly
enjoined him not to get his head broke at back-swording, on
pain of her highest displeasure; but as she is not to be seen
(the women pretend not to like to see the back-sword play,
and keep away from the stage), and as his hat is decidedly
getting old, he chucks it on to the stage, and follows himself,
hoping that he will only have to break other people's
heads, or that after all Rachel won't really mind.</p>

<p>Then follows the greasy cap, lined with fur, of a half-gipsy,
poaching,<a name="FNanchor_56_166" id="FNanchor_56_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_166" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> loafing fellow who travels the Vale not
for much good, I fancy:</p>

<div class="poem"><p>
"Full twenty times was Peter feared<br />
For once that Peter was respected,"<a name="FNanchor_A_169" id="FNanchor_A_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_169" class="fnanchor">[B]</a><br />
</p></div>

<p>in fact. And then three or four other hats, including the
glossy castor<a name="FNanchor_57_167" id="FNanchor_57_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_167" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> of Joe Willis, the self-elected and would-be
champion of the neighborhood, a well-to-do young
butcher of twenty-eight or thereabouts, and a great strapping
fellow, with his full allowance of bluster. This is a
capital show of gamesters, considering the amount of the
prize; so, while they are picking their sticks and drawing
their lots, I think I must tell you, as shortly as I can, how
the noble old game of back-sword is played; for it has
sadly gone out of late, even in the Vale, and maybe you
have never seen it.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_169" id="Footnote_A_169"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_169"><span class="label">[B]</span></a>
Wordsworth's "Peter Bell."</p></div>

<p>The weapon is a good stout ash-stick with a large basket-handle,<a name="FNanchor_58_168" id="FNanchor_58_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_168" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
heavier and some what shorter than a common single-stick.
The players are called "old gamesters"&mdash;why, I
can't tell you&mdash;and their object is simply to break one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
another's head: for the moment that blood runs an inch anywhere
above the eyebrow, the old gamester to whom it belongs
is beaten, and has to stop. A very slight blow with
the sticks will fetch blood, so that it is by no means a punishing
pastime, if the men don't play on purpose, and savagely,
at the bodies and arms of their adversaries. The
old gamester going into action only takes off his hat and
coat, and arms himself with a stick; he then loops the
fingers of his left hand in a handkerchief or strap, which
he fastens round his left leg, measuring the length, so that
when he draws it tight with his left elbow in the air, that
elbow shall just reach as high as his crown. Thus you
see, so long as he chooses to keep his left elbow up, regardless
of cuts, he has a perfect guard for the left side of his
head. Then he advances his right hand above and in
front of his head, holding his stick across, so that its point
projects an inch or two over his left elbow; and thus his
whole head is completely guarded, and he faces his man
armed in like manner; and they stand some three feet
apart, often nearer, and feint,<a name="FNanchor_59_170" id="FNanchor_59_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_170" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> and strike, and return at
one another's head, until one cries "hold," or blood flows.
In the first case they are allowed a minute's time, and go
on again; in the latter, another pair of gamesters are
called on. If good men are playing, the quickness of the
return is marvellous; you hear the rattle like that a boy
makes drawing his stick along palings, only heavier; and
the closeness of the men in action to one another gives it
a strange interest, and makes a spell at back-swording a
very noble sight.</p>


<h4>JOE AND THE GIPSY.</h4>

<p>They are all suited now with sticks, and Joe Willis and
the gipsy man have drawn the first lot. So the rest lean
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
against the rails of the stage, and Joe and the dark man
meet in the middle, the boards having been strewed with
sawdust; Joe's white shirt and spotless drab breeches and
boots contrasting with the gipsy's coarse blue shirt and
dirty green velveteen breeches and leather gaiters. Joe
is evidently turning up his nose at the other, and half insulted
at having to break his head.</p>

<p>The gipsy is a tough, active fellow, but not very skilful
with his weapon, so that Joe's weight and strength
tell in a minute; he is too heavy metal for him; whack,
whack, whack, come his blows, breaking down the gipsy's
guard, and threatening to reach his head every moment.
There it is at last&mdash;"Blood, blood!" shouted the spectators,
as a thin stream oozes out slowly from the roots of
his hair, and the umpire<a name="FNanchor_60_171" id="FNanchor_60_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_171" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> calls to them to stop. The gipsy
scowls at Joe under his brows in no pleasant manner,
while Master Joe swaggers about, and makes attitudes,
and thinks himself, and shows that he thinks himself, the
greatest man in the field.</p>

<p>Then follow several stout sets-to between the other candidates
for the new hat, and at last come to the shepherd
and Willum Smith. This is the crack set-to of the day.
They are both in famous wind, and there is no crying
"hold"; the shepherd is an old hand, and up to all the
dodges; he tries them one after another, and very nearly
gets at Willum's head by coming in near, and playing
over his guard at the half-stick, but somehow Willum
blunders through, catching the stick on his shoulders,
neck, sides, every now and then, anywhere but on his
head, and his returns are heavy and straight, and he is the
youngest gamester and a favorite in the parish, and his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
gallant stand brings down shouts and cheers, and the
knowing ones think he'll win if he keeps steady, and Tom,
on the groom's shoulder, holds his hands together, and
can hardly breathe for excitement.</p>

<p>Alas for Willum! his sweetheart, getting tired of female
companionship, has been hunting the booths to see where
he can have got to, and now catches sight of him on the
stage in full combat. She flushes and turns pale; her old
aunt catches hold of her saying: "Bless 'ee,<a name="FNanchor_61_172" id="FNanchor_61_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_172" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> child, doan't
'ee go a'nigst<a name="FNanchor_62_173" id="FNanchor_62_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_173" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> it;" but she breaks away and runs toward
the stage calling his name. Willum keeps up his guard
stoutly, but glances for a moment toward the voice. No
guard will do it, Willum, without the eye. The shepherd
steps round and strikes, and the point of his stick just
grazes Willum's forehead, fetching off the skin, and the
blood flows, and the umpire cries "Hold," and poor Willum's
chance is up for the day. But he takes it very well,
and puts on his old hat and coat, and goes down to be
scolded by his sweetheart, and led away out of mischief.
Tom hears him say coaxingly as he walks off:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now doan't ee, Rachel! I wouldn't ha' done it, only
I wanted summut<a name="FNanchor_63_174" id="FNanchor_63_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_174" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> to buy ee a fairing wi', and I be as
vlush<a name="FNanchor_64_175" id="FNanchor_64_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_175" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> o' money as a twod<a name="FNanchor_65_176" id="FNanchor_65_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_176" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> o' veathers."<a name="FNanchor_66_177" id="FNanchor_66_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_177" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>"Thee minds what I tells ee," rejoins Rachel, saucily,
"and doan't ee keep blethering<a name="FNanchor_67_178" id="FNanchor_67_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_178" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> about fairings." Tom
resolves in his heart to give Willum the remainder of his
two shillings after the back-swording.</p>

<p>Joe Willis had all the luck to-day. His next bout ends
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
in an easy victory, while the shepherd has a tough job to
break his second head; and when Joe and the shepherd
meet, and the whole circle expect and hope to see him get
a broken crown, the shepherd slips in the first round, and
falls against the rails, hurting himself so that the old farmer
will not let him go on, much as he wishes to try; and
that imposter, Joe (for he is certainly not the best man)
struts and swaggers about the stage the conquering gamester,
though he hasn't had five minutes' really trying play.</p>

<h4>A NEW "OLD GAMESTER."</h4>

<p>Joe takes the new hat in his hand, and puts the money
in it, and then, as if a thought strikes him, and he doesn't
think his victory quite acknowledged down below, walks
to each face of the stage, and looks down, shaking the
money, and chaffing, as how he'll stake hat and money
and another half sovereign, "agin any gamester as hasn't
played already." Cunning Joe! he thus gets rid of Willum
and the shepherd who is quite fresh again.</p>

<p>No one seems to like the offer, and the umpire is just
coming down, when a queer old hat, something like a doctor
of divinity's shovel,<a name="FNanchor_68_179" id="FNanchor_68_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_179" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> is chucked on the stage, and an
elderly quiet man steps out, who has been watching the
play, saying he should like to cross a stick "wi' the prodigalish
young chap."</p>

<p>The crowd cheer and begin to chaff Joe, who turns up
his nose and swaggers across to the sticks. "Imp'dent old
wos-bird!"<a name="FNanchor_69_180" id="FNanchor_69_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_180" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> says he, "I'll break the bald head on un to
the truth."</p>

<p>The old boy is very bald, certainly, and the blood will
show fast enough if you touch him, Joe.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>
<h4>JOE OUT OF LUCK.</h4>

<p>He takes off his long-flapped coat, and stands up in a
long-flapped waistcoat, which Sir Roger de Coverley<a name="FNanchor_70_181" id="FNanchor_70_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_181" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
might have worn when it was new, picks out a stick, and
is ready for Master Joe, who loses no time, but begins
his old game, whack, whack, whack, trying to break down
the old man's guard by sheer strength. But it won't
do&mdash;he catches every blow close by the basket: and
though he is rather stiff in his returns, after a minute
walks Joe about the stage, and is clearly a staunch old
gamester. Joe now comes in, and making the most of his
height, tries to get over the old man's guard at half stick,
by which he takes a smart blow in the ribs and another on
the elbow, and nothing more. And now he loses wind
and begins to puff, and the crowd laugh: "Cry, 'hold,'
Joe&mdash;thee's met thy match!" Instead of taking good
advice and getting his wind, Joe loses his temper and
strikes at the old man's body.</p>

<p>"Blood, blood!" shout the crowd, "Joe's head's broke!"</p>

<p>Who'd have thought it? How did it come? That body-blow
left Joe's head unguarded for a moment, and with one
turn of the wrist the old gentleman has picked a neat bit
of skin off the middle of his forehead; and though he
won't believe it, and hammers on for three more blows
despite of the shouts, is then convinced by the blood trickling
into his eyes. Poor Joe is sadly crestfallen, and
fumbles in his pocket for the other half-sovereign, but the
old gamester won't have it. "Keep thy money, man, and
gi's<a name="FNanchor_71_182" id="FNanchor_71_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_182" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> thy hand," says he, and they shake hands; but the
old gamester gives the hat to the shepherd, and, soon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
after, the half-sovereign to Willum, who thereout decorates
his sweetheart with ribbons to his heart's content.</p>

<p>"Who can a<a name="FNanchor_72_183" id="FNanchor_72_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_183" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> be! Wur<a name="FNanchor_73_184" id="FNanchor_73_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_184" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> do a cum from?" ask the
crowd. And it soon flies about that the west-country
champion, who played a tie<a name="FNanchor_74_185" id="FNanchor_74_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_185" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> with Shaw, the life-guardsman<a name="FNanchor_75_186" id="FNanchor_75_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_186" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
at "Vizes"<a name="FNanchor_76_187" id="FNanchor_76_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_187" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> twenty years before, has broken Joe
Willis's crown for him.</p>

<h4>THE REVELS ARE OVER.</h4>

<p>How my country fair is spinning out! I see I must
skip the wrestling, and the boys jumping in sacks, and
rolling wheelbarrows blindfolded; and the donkey-race,
and the fight which arose thereout, marring the otherwise
peaceful "veast," and the frightened scurrying away
of the female feast-goers, and descent of Squire Brown,
summoned by the wife of one of the combatants to stop it,
which he wouldn't start to do till he had got on his top-boots.
Tom is carried away by old Benjy, dog-tired and
surfeited with pleasure, as the evening comes on and the
dancing begins in the booths; and though Willum and
Rachel in her new ribbons, and many another good lad
and lass, don't come away just yet, but have a good step
out and enjoy it, and get no harm thereby, yet we, being
sober folk, will just stroll away up through the church-yard,
and by the old yew-tree; and get a quiet dish of tea
and bit of talk with our gossips, as the steady ones of our
village do, and so to bed.</p>

<h4>THE OLD BOY MORALIZETH ON VEASTS.</h4>

<p>That's a fair, true sketch, as far as it goes, of one of the
larger village feasts in the Vale of Berks, when I was a
little boy. They are much altered for the worse, I am
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
told. I haven't been at one these twenty years, but I
have been at the statute fairs in some west-country towns,
where servants are hired, and greater abominations cannot
be found. What village feasts have come to, I fear, in
many cases, may be read in the pages of "Yeast,<a name="FNanchor_77_188" id="FNanchor_77_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_188" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>" though
I never saw one so bad&mdash;thank God!</p>

<p>Do you want to know why? It is because, as I said
before, gentlefolk and farmers have left off joining or
taking any interest in them. They don't either subscribe
to the prizes, or go down and enjoy the fun.</p>

<p>Is this a good or a bad sign? I hardly know. Bad,
sure enough, if it only arises from the further separation
of classes consequent on twenty years of buying cheap and
selling dear, and its accompanying overwork; or because
our sons and daughters have their hearts in London club-life,
or so-called society, instead of in the old English
home duties; because farmers' sons are aping fine gentlemen,
and farmers' daughters caring more to make bad foreign
music than good English cheeses. Good, perhaps,
if it be that the time for the old "veast" has gone by,
that it is no longer the healthy, sound expression of English
country holiday-making; that, in fact, we as a nation
have got beyond it, and are in a transition state, feeling
for and soon likely to find some better substitute.</p>

<p>Only I have just got this to say before I quit the text.
Don't let reformers of any sort think that they are going
really to lay hold of the working boys and young men of
England by any educational grapnel<a name="FNanchor_78_189" id="FNanchor_78_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_189" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> whatever, which
hasn't some <i>bona fide</i><a name="FNanchor_79_190" id="FNanchor_79_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_190" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> equivalent for the games of the old
country "veast" in it; something to put in the place of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
the back-swording and wrestling and racing; something to
try the muscles of men's bodies, and the endurance of their
hearts, and to make them rejoice in their strength. In
all the new-fangled comprehensive plans which I see, this
is all left out; and the consequence is that your great
Mechanics' Institutes end in intellectual priggism;<a name="FNanchor_80_191" id="FNanchor_80_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_191" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> and
your Christian Young Men Societies in religious Pharisaism.</p>

<h4>ADVICE TO YOUNG SWELLS.</h4>

<p>Well, well, we must bide our time. Life isn't all beer
and skittles,&mdash;but beer and skittles,<a name="FNanchor_81_192" id="FNanchor_81_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_192" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> or something better
of the same sort, must form a good part of every Englishman's
education. If I could only drive this into the heads
of you rising Parliamentary lords and young swells who
"have your ways made for you," as the saying is,&mdash;you
who frequent palaver houses<a name="FNanchor_82_193" id="FNanchor_82_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_193" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> and West-End clubs,<a name="FNanchor_83_194" id="FNanchor_83_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_194" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> waiting,
always ready to strap yourselves on to the back of
poor dear old John,<a name="FNanchor_84_195" id="FNanchor_84_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_195" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> as soon as the present used-up lot
(your fathers and uncles), who sit there on the great Parliamentary-majorities'
pack-saddle, and make believe they
are guiding him with their red-tape<a name="FNanchor_85_196" id="FNanchor_85_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_196" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> bridle, tumble, or
have to be lifted off.</p>

<p>I don't think much of you yet&mdash;I wish I could; though
you do go talking and lecturing up and down the country
to crowded audiences, and are busy with all sorts of philanthropic
intellectualism, and circulating libraries and
museums, and Heaven only knows what besides, and try
to make us think, through newspaper reports, that you
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
are, even as we, of the working classes. But, bless your
hearts, we "aren't so green," though lots of us of all sorts
toady<a name="FNanchor_86_197" id="FNanchor_86_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_197" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> you enough certainly, and try to make you think
so.</p>

<p>I'll tell you what to do now; instead of all this trumpeting
and fuss, which is only the old Parliamentary-majority
dodge over again&mdash;just you go each of you
(you've plenty of time for it, if you'll only give, up t'other
line) and quietly make three or four friends, real friends
among us. You'll find a little trouble in getting at the
right sort, because such birds don't come lightly to your
lure,&mdash;but found they may be. Take, say, two out of the
professions, lawyer, parson, doctor&mdash;which you will; one
out of trade, and three or four out of the working-classes,
tailors, engineers, carpenters, engravers&mdash;there's plenty of
choice. Let them be men of your own ages, mind, and
ask them to your homes; introduce them to your wives
and sisters, and get introduced to theirs, give them good
dinners, and talk to them about what is really at the bottom
of your hearts; and box, and run, and row with them,
when you have a chance. Do all this honestly as man to
man, and by the time you come to ride old John, you'll
be able to do something more than sit on his back, and
may feel his mouth with some stronger bridle than a red-tape
one.</p>

<p>Ah, if you only would! But you have got too far out
of the right rut, I fear. Too much over civilization, and
the deceitfulness of riches. It is easier for a camel to go
through the eye of a needle. More's the pity. I never
came across but two of you who could value a man wholly
and solely for what was in him; who thought themselves
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
verily and indeed of the same flesh and blood as John
Jones, the attorney's clerk, and Bill Smith, the costermonger,<a name="FNanchor_87_198" id="FNanchor_87_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_198" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
and could act as if they thought so.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>SUNDRY WARS AND ALLIANCES.</h3>


<p>"Poor old Benjy! the "rheumatiz" has much to answer
for all through English country-sides,<a name="FNanchor_1_199" id="FNanchor_1_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_199" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> but it never
played a scurvier trick than in laying thee by the heels,
when thou wast yet in a green old age. The enemy, which
had long been carrying on a sort of border warfare, and
trying his strength against Benjy's on the battlefield of his
hands and legs, now, mustering all his forces, began laying
siege to the citadel, and overrunning the whole country.
Benjy was seized in the back and loins; and though he
made strong and brave fight, it was soon clear enough that
all which could be beaten of poor old Benjy would have to
give in before long.</p>

<p>It was as much as he could do now, with the help of his
big stick and frequent stops, to hobble down to the canal
with Master Tom, and bait his hook for him, and sit and
watch his angling, telling him quaint old country stories;
and when Tom had no sport, and detecting a rat some hundred
yards or so off along the bank, would rush off with
Toby, the turnspit<a name="FNanchor_2_200" id="FNanchor_2_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_200" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> terrier, his other faithful companion,
in bootless pursuit, he might have tumbled in and been
drowned twenty times over before Benjy could have got
near him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
Cheery and unmindful of himself as Benjy was, this loss
of locomotive power bothered him greatly. He had got a
new object in his old age, and was just beginning to think
himself useful again in the world. He feared much, too,
lest Master Tom should fall back again into the hands of
Charity and the women. So he tried everything he could
think of to get set up. He even went on an expedition to
the dwelling of one of those queer mortals, who&mdash;say
what we will and reason how we will&mdash;do cure simple
people of diseases of one kind or another without the aid
of physic; and so get to themselves the reputation of using
charms, and inspire for themselves and their dwellings great
respect, not to say fear, amongst a simple folk such as the
dwellers in the Vale of White Horse. Where this power,
or whatever else it may be, descends upon the shoulders
of a man whose ways are not straight, he becomes a nuisance
to the neighborhood; a receiver of stolen goods, the
avowed enemy of law and order. Sometimes, however,
they are of quite a different stamp, men who pretend to
know nothing, and are with difficulty persuaded to exercise
their occult<a name="FNanchor_3_201" id="FNanchor_3_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_201" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> arts in the simplest cases.</p>

<h4>BENJY RESORTS TO A "WISE MAN."</h4>

<p>Of this latter sort was old Farmer Ives, as he was called,
the "wise man" to whom Benjy resorted (taking Tom
with him as usual), in the early spring of the year next
after the feast described in the last chapter. Why he was
called "farmer" I cannot say, unless it be that he was the
owner of a cow, a pig or two, and some poultry, which he
maintained on about an acre of land inclosed from the
middle of a wild common, on which probably his father
had squatted before lords of manors<a name="FNanchor_4_202" id="FNanchor_4_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_202" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> looked as keenly after
their rights as they do now. Here he had lived no one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
knew how long, a solitary man. It was often rumored
that he was to be turned out and his cottage pulled down,
but somehow it never came to pass; and his pigs and cow
went grazing on the common, and his geese hissed at the
passing children and at the heels of the horse of my lord's
steward, who often rode by with a covetous eye on the
inclosure, still unmolested. His dwelling was some miles
from our village; so Benjy, who was half ashamed of his
errand, and wholly unable to walk there, had to exercise
much ingenuity to get the means of transporting himself
and Tom thither without exciting suspicion. However,
one fine May morning he managed to borrow the old blind
pony of our friend the publican,<a name="FNanchor_5_203" id="FNanchor_5_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_203" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and Tom persuaded
Madam Brown to give him a holiday to spend with old
Benjy, and to lend them the squire's light cart, stored with
bread and cold meat and a bottle of ale. And so the two
in high glee started behind old Dobbin, and jogged along
the deep-rutted plashy roads, which had not been mended
after their winter's wear, toward the dwelling of the wizard.
About noon they passed the gate which opened on to the
large common, and old Dobbin toiled slowly up the hill,
while Benjy pointed out a little deep dingle on the left,
out of which welled a tiny stream. As they crept up the
hill the tops of a few birch-trees came in sight, and blue
smoke curling up through their delicate light boughs; and
then the little white thatched home and inclosed ground
of Farmer Ives, lying cradled in the dingle,<a name="FNanchor_6_204" id="FNanchor_6_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_204" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> with the gay
gorse common rising behind and on both sides; while in
front, after traversing a gentle slope, the eye might travel
for miles and miles over the rich Vale. They now left the
main road and struck into a green track over the common,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
marked lightly with wheel and horse-shoe, which led down
into the dingle and stopped at the rough gate of Farmer
Ives. Here they found the farmer, an iron-gray old man,
with a bushy eyebrow and strong aquiline nose busied in
one of his vocations. He was a horse and cow doctor, and
was tending a sick beast which had been sent up to be
cured. Benjy hailed him as an old friend, and he returned
the greeting cordially enough, looking, however, hard for
a moment both at Benjy and Tom, to see whether there
was more in their visit than appeared at first sight. It
was a work of some difficulty and danger for Benjy to reach
the ground, which, however, he managed to do without mishap;
and then he devoted himself to unharnessing Dobbin,
and turning him out for a graze ("a run" one could not
say of that virtuous steed) on the common. This done, he
extricated the cold provisions from the cart, and they entered
the farmer's wicket;<a name="FNanchor_7_205" id="FNanchor_7_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_205" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and he, shutting up the knife
with which he was at work, accompanied them toward the cottage.
A big old lurcher<a name="FNanchor_8_206" id="FNanchor_8_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_206" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> got up slowly from the doorstone,
stretching first one hind leg, and then the other, and taking
Tom's caresses and the presence of Toby, who kept, however,
at a respectful distance, with equal indifference.</p>

<p>"Us be come to pay ee a visit. I've a been long minded
to do't for old sake's sake, only I vinds I dwont get
about now as I'd used to't. I be so plaguy bad wi' th'
rhumatiz in my back." Benjy paused, in hopes of drawing
the farmer at once on the subject of his ailment without
further direct application.</p>

<p>"Ah, I see as you bean't quite so lissom<a name="FNanchor_9_207" id="FNanchor_9_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_207" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> as you was,"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
replied the farmer, with a grim smile, as he lifted the latch
of his door. "We bean't so young as we was, nother<a name="FNanchor_10_208" id="FNanchor_10_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_208" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> on
us, wuss luck."</p>

<h4>THE "WISE MAN'S" SURROUNDINGS.</h4>

<p>The farmer's cottage was very like those of the better
class of peasantry in general. A snug chimney-corner
with two seats and a small carpet on the hearth, an old
flint gun and a pair of spurs over the fire-place, a dresser<a name="FNanchor_11_209" id="FNanchor_11_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_209" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
with shelves, on which some bright pewter plates and
crockery-ware were arranged, an old walnut table, a few
chairs and settles,<a name="FNanchor_12_210" id="FNanchor_12_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_210" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> some framed samplers<a name="FNanchor_13_211" id="FNanchor_13_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_211" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and an old print
or two, and a book-case with some dozen volumes on the
walls, a rack with flitches<a name="FNanchor_14_212" id="FNanchor_14_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_212" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> of bacon and other stores fastened
to the ceiling, and you have the best part of the
furniture. No sign of occult art is to be seen, unless
the bundles of dried herbs hanging to the rack and in the
ingle,<a name="FNanchor_15_213" id="FNanchor_15_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_213" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and the row of labelled vials on one of the shelves
betoken it.</p>

<p>Tom played about with some kittens who occupied the
hearth, and with a goat who walked demurely in at the
open door, while their host and Benjy spread the table for
dinner&mdash;and was soon engaged in conflict with the cold
meat, to which he did much honor. The two old men's
talk was of old comrades and their deeds, mute inglorious
Miltons<a name="FNanchor_16_214" id="FNanchor_16_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_214" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> of the Vale, and of the doings thirty years back&mdash;which
didn't interest him much, except when they spoke
of the making of the canal; and then, indeed, he began to
listen with all his ears, and learned, to his no small wonder,
that his dear and wonderful canal had not been there
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
always&mdash;was not, in fact, as old as Benjy or Farmer Ives,
which caused a strange commotion in his small brain.</p>

<p>After dinner Benjy called attention to a wart which
Tom had on the knuckles of his hand, and which the
family doctor had been trying his skill on without success,
and begged the farmer to charm it away. Farmer Ives
looked at it, muttered something or another over it, and
cut some notches in a short stick, which he handed to
Benjy, giving him instructions for cutting it down on
certain days, and cautioning Tom not to meddle with the
wart for a fortnight. And then they strolled out and sat
on a bench in the sun with their pipes, and the pigs came
up and grunted sociably and let Tom scratch them; and
the farmer, seeing how he liked animals, stood up and
held his arms in the air and gave a call, which brought a
flock of pigeons wheeling and dashing through the birch-trees.
They settled down in clusters on the farmer's arms
and shoulders, making love to him and scrambling over
one another's back to get to his face; and then he threw
them all off, and they fluttered about close by, and lighted
on him again and again when he held up his arms. All
the creatures about the place were clean and fearless,
quite unlike their relations elsewhere; and Tom begged
to be taught how to make all the pigs and cows and poultry
in our village tame, at which the farmer only gave one
of his grim chuckles.</p>

<h4>BENJY'S RHEUMATISM.</h4>

<p>It wasn't till they were just ready to go, and old Dobbin
was harnessed, that Benjy broached the subject of
his rheumatism again, detailing his symptoms one by one.
Poor old boy! He hoped the farmer could charm it away
as easily as he could Tom's wart, and was ready with
equal faith to put another notched stick into his other
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
pocket for the cure of his ailments. The physician shook
his head, but nevertheless produced a bottle and handed
it to Benjy with instructions for use. "Not as t'll do ee
much good&mdash;leastways I be afeared not," shading his
eyes with his hand and looking up at them in the cart;
"there's only one thing as I knows on, as'll cure old folks
like you and I o' th' rhumatiz."</p>

<p>"Wot be that, then, farmer?" inquired Benjy.</p>

<p>"Church-yard mold," said the old iron-gray man with
another chuckle. And so they said their good-byes and
went their ways home. Tom's wart was gone in a fortnight,
but not so Benjy's rheumatism, which laid him by
the heels more and more. And though Tom still spent
many an hour with him, as he sat on a bench in the sunshine,
or by the chimney-corner when it was cold, he soon
had to seek elsewhere for his regular companions.</p>

<p>Tom had been accustomed often to accompany his
mother in her visits to the cottages, and had thereby
made acquaintances with many of the village boys of his
own age. There was Job Rudkin, son of widow Rudkin,
the most bustling woman in the parish. How she could
ever have had such a stolid<a name="FNanchor_17_215" id="FNanchor_17_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_215" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> boy as Job for a child, must
always remain a mystery. The first time Tom went to
their cottage with his mother, Job was not indoors, but
he entered soon after, and stood with both hands in his
pockets staring at Tom. Widow Rudkin, who would have
had to cross Madam to get at young Hopeful&mdash;a breach of
good manners of which she was wholly incapable&mdash;began
a series of pantomime signs, which only puzzled him, and
at last, unable to contain herself longer, burst out with,
"Job! Job! where's thy cap?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>
<p>"What! beant ee on ma head, mother?" replied Job,
slowly extricating one hand from a pocket and feeling for
the article in question; which he found on his head sure
enough, and left there, to his mother's horror and Tom's
great delight.</p>

<p>Then there was poor Jacob Dodson, the half-witted boy,
who ambled about cheerfully, undertaking messages and
little helpful odds and ends, for every one, which, however,
poor Jacob managed always hopelessly to embrangle.<a name="FNanchor_18_216" id="FNanchor_18_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_216" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
Everything came to pieces in his hands, and nothing
would stop in his head. They nicknamed him Jacob
Doodle-calf.</p>

<p>But above all there was Harry Winburn, the quickest
and best boy in the parish. He might be a year older
than Tom, but was very little bigger, and he was the
Crichton<a name="FNanchor_19_217" id="FNanchor_19_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_217" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> of our village boys. He could wrestle and
climb and run better than all the rest, and learned all that
the schoolmaster could teach him faster than that worthy
at all liked. He was a boy to be proud of, with his curly
brown hair, keen gray eye, straight active figure, and little
ears and hands and feet&mdash;"as fine as a lord's," as Charity
remarked to Tom one day, talking as usual great nonsense.
Lords' hands and ears and feet are just as ugly as other
folks' when they are children, as any one may convince
himself if he likes to look. Tight boots and gloves,
and doing nothing with them, I allow make a difference
by the time they are twenty.</p>

<h4>TORYISM OF SQUIRE BROWN.</h4>

<p>Now that Benjy was laid on the shelf, and his young
brothers were still under petticoat government, Tom, in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
search of companions, began to cultivate the village boys
generally more and more. Squire Brown, be it said, was
a true blue<a name="FNanchor_20_218" id="FNanchor_20_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_218" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Tory<a name="FNanchor_21_219" id="FNanchor_21_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_219" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> to the backbone, and believed honestly
that the powers which be were ordained of God, and that
loyalty and steadfast obedience were man's first duties.
Whether it were in consequence or in spite of his political
creed, I do not mean to give an opinion, though I have
one; but certain it is, that he held therewith divers social
principles not generally supposed to be true blue in color.
Foremost of these, and the one which the Squire loved to
propound above all others, was the belief that a man is to
be valued wholly and solely for that which he is in himself,
for that which stands up in the four fleshy walls of him,
apart from clothes, rank, fortune, and all externals whatsoever.
Which belief I take to be a wholesome corrective
of all political opinions, and, if held sincerely, to make
all opinions equally harmless, whether they be blue, red
or green. As a necessary corollary<a name="FNanchor_22_220" id="FNanchor_22_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_220" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> to this belief, Squire
Brown held further that it didn't matter a straw whether
his son associated with lords' sons or plowmen's sons,
provided they were brave and honest. He himself had
played foot-ball and gone birds'-nesting with the farmers
whom he met at vestry<a name="FNanchor_23_221" id="FNanchor_23_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_221" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and the laborers who tilled their
fields, and so had his father and grandfather, with their
progenitors.<a name="FNanchor_24_222" id="FNanchor_24_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_222" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> So he encouraged Tom in his intimacy with
the boys of the village, and forwarded it by all means in
his power, and gave them the run of a close<a name="FNanchor_25_223" id="FNanchor_25_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_223" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> for a playground,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
and provided bats and balls and a foot-ball for
their sports.</p>

<h4>TOM'S WATCH-TOWER BY THE SCHOOL.</h4>

<p>Our village was blessed, amongst other things, with a
well-endowed school. The building stood by itself, apart
from the master's house, on an angle of ground where
three roads met; an old gray stone building, with a steep
roof and mullioned<a name="FNanchor_26_224" id="FNanchor_26_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_224" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> windows. On one of the opposite
angles stood Squire Brown's stables and kennel, with their
backs to the road, over which towered a great elm-tree;
on the third, stood the village carpenter and wheelwright's
large open shop, and his house and the schoolmaster's, with
long, low eaves under which the swallows built by scores.</p>

<p>The moment Tom's lessons were over, he would now
get him down to this corner by the stables, and watch till
the boys came out of school. He prevailed on the groom
to cut notches for him in the bark of the elm, so that he
could climb into the lower branches, and there he would
sit watching the school-door, and speculating on the possibility
of turning the elm into a dwelling-place for himself
and friends after the manner of the Swiss Family
Robinson.<a name="FNanchor_27_225" id="FNanchor_27_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_225" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> But the school hours were long and Tom's
patience short; so that he soon began to descend into the
street, and go and peep in at the school-door and the
wheelwright's shop, and look out for something to while
away the time. Now the wheelwright was a choleric<a name="FNanchor_28_226" id="FNanchor_28_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_226" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
man, and one fine afternoon, returning from a short
absence, found Tom occupied with one of his pet adzes,
the edge of which was fast vanishing under our hero's
care. A speedy flight saved Tom from all but one sound
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
cuff on the ears, but he resented this unjustifiable interruption
of his first essays at carpentering, and still more
the further proceedings of the wheelwright, who cut a
switch and hung it over the door of his workshop, threatening
to use it upon Tom if he came within twenty yards
of his gate. So Tom, to retaliate, commenced a war upon
the swallows who dwelt under the wheelwright's eaves,
whom he harassed with sticks and stones, and being
fleeter of foot than his enemy, escaped all punishment,
and kept him in perpetual anger. Moreover, his presence
about the school-door began to incense the master, as the
boys in that neighborhood neglected their lessons in consequence:
and more than once he issued into the porch,
rod in hand, just as Tom beat a hasty retreat. And he
and the wheelwright, laying their heads together, resolved
to acquaint the squire with Tom's afternoon occupations;
but, in order to do it with effect, determined to take him
captive and lead him away to judgment fresh from his
evil doings. This they would have found some difficulty
in doing, had Tom continued the war single-handed, or
rather single-footed, for he would have taken to the
deepest part of Pebbly Brook to escape them; but, like
other active powers, he was ruined by his alliances. Poor
Jacob Doodle-calf could not go to the school with the other
boys, and one fine afternoon, about three o'clock (the
school broke up at four) Tom found him ambling about
the street, and pressed him into a visit to the school-porch.
Jacob, always ready to do what was asked, consented, and
the two stole down to the school together. Tom first
reconnoitered<a name="FNanchor_29_227" id="FNanchor_29_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_227" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> the wheelwright's shop, and seeing no
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
signs of activity, thought all safe in that quarter, and
ordered at once an advance of all his troops upon the
school-porch. The door of the school was ajar, and the
boys seated on the nearest bench at once recognized and
opened a correspondence with the invaders. Tom, waxing
bold, kept putting his head into the school and making
faces at the master when his back was turned. Poor
Jacob, not in the least comprehending the situation, and
in high glee at finding himself so near the school, which
he had never been allowed to enter, suddenly, in a fit of
enthusiasm, pushed by Tom, and ambling three steps into
the school, stood there, looking round him and nodding
with a self-approving smile. The master who was stooping
over a boy's slate, with his back to the door, became
aware of something unusual, and turned quickly round.
Tom rushed at Jacob, and began dragging him back by
his smock-frock, and the master made at them, scattering
forms<a name="FNanchor_30_228" id="FNanchor_30_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_228" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> and boys in his career. Even now they might
have escaped, but that in the porch, barring retreat,
appeared the crafty wheelwright, who had been watching
all their proceedings. So they were seized, the school
dismissed, and Tom and Jacob led away to Squire Brown
as lawful prizes, the boys following to the gate in groups,
and speculating on the result.</p>

<h4>DEFEAT, CAPTURE, PEACE.</h4>

<p>The Squire was very angry at first, but the interview,
with Tom's pleading, ended in a compromise. Tom was
not to go near the school till three o'clock, and only then
if he had done his own lessons well, in which case he was
to be the bearer of a note to the master from Squire
Brown; and the master agreed in such case to release ten
or twelve of the best boys an hour before the time of breaking
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
up, to go off and play in the close. The wheelwright's
adzes and swallows were to be forever respected; and that
hero and the master withdrew to the servants' hall,<a name="FNanchor_31_229" id="FNanchor_31_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_229" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> to
drink the Squire's health, well satisfied with their day's
work.</p>

<p>The second act of Tom's life may now be said to have
begun. The war of independence had been over for some
time; none of the women now, not even his mother's maid,
dared offer to help him in dressing or washing. Between
ourselves, he had often at first to run to Benjy in an unfinished
state of toilet. Charity and the rest of them
seemed to take a delight in putting impossible buttons
and ties in the middle of his back; but he would have
gone without nether<a name="FNanchor_32_230" id="FNanchor_32_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_230" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> integuments<a name="FNanchor_33_231" id="FNanchor_33_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_231" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> altogether, sooner than
have had recourse to female valeting. He had a room to
himself, and his father gave him sixpence a week pocket-money.
All this he had achieved by Benjy's advice and
assistance. But now he had conquered another step in
life, the step which all real boys so long to make; he had
got amongst his equals in age and strength, and could
measure himself with other boys; he lived with those
whose pursuits and wishes and ways were the same in
kind as his own.</p>

<h4>PLAY AND WORK.</h4>

<p>The little governess, who had lately been installed in the
house, found her work grow wondrously easy, for Tom
slaved at his lessons in order to make sure of his note to
the schoolmaster. So there were very few days in the
week in which Tom and the village boys were not playing
in their close by three o'clock. Prisoner's base,<a name="FNanchor_34_232" id="FNanchor_34_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_232" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> rounders,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
high-cock-a-lorum, cricket, foot-ball, he was soon initiated
into the delights of them all; and though most of the
boys were older than himself, he managed to hold his own
very well. He was naturally active and strong, and quick
of eye and hand, and had the advantage of light shoes and
well-fitting dress, so that in a short time he could run and
jump and climb with any of them.</p>

<h4>RIDING AND WRESTLING.</h4>

<p>They generally finished their regular games half an hour
or so before tea-time, and then began trials of skill and
strength in many ways. Some of them would catch the
Shetland pony who was turned out in the field, and get
two or three together on his back, and the little rogue,
enjoying the fun, would gallop off for fifty yards and
then turn round, or stop short and shoot them on to the
turf, and then gaze quietly on till he felt another load;
others played at peg-top or marbles, while a few of the
bigger ones stood up for a bout at wrestling. Tom at
first only looked on at this pastime, but it had peculiar
attractions for him, and he could not long keep out of it.
Elbow and collar wrestling, as practised in the western
counties, was, next to back-swording, the way to fame for
the youth of the Vale; and all the boys knew the rules of
it, and were more or less expert. But Job Rudkin and
Harry Winburn were the stars, the former stiff and sturdy,
with legs like small towers, the latter pliant as india-rubber
and quick as lightning. Day after day they stood foot to
foot, and offered first one hand and then the other, and
grappled, and closed, and swayed, and strained, till a well-aimed
crook of the heel or thrust of the loin took effect,
and a fair backfall ended the matter. And Tom watched
with all his eyes, and first challenged one of the less
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
scientific, and threw him; and so one by one wrestled his
way up to the leaders.</p>

<p>Then indeed for months he had a poor time of it; it
was not long indeed before he could manage to keep his
legs against Job, for that hero was slow of offence, and
gained his victories chiefly by allowing others to throw
themselves against his immovable legs and loins, but
Harry Winburn was undeniably his master; from the first
clutch of hands when they stood up, down to the last trip
which sent him on his back on the turf, he felt that Harry
knew more and could do more than he. Luckily Harry's
bright unconsciousness, and Tom's natural good temper,
kept them from ever quarrelling; and so Tom worked on
and on, and trod more and more nearly on Harry's heels,
and at last mastered all the dodges and falls except one.
This one was Harry's own particular invention and pet;
he scarcely ever used it except when hard pressed, but
then out it came, and, as sure as it did, over went poor
Tom. He thought about that fall at his meals, in his
walks, when he lay awake in bed, in his dreams,&mdash;but all
to no purpose; until Harry one day in his open way suggested
to him how he thought it should be met, and in a
week from that time the boys were equal, save only the
slight difference of strength in Harry's favor, which some
extra ten months of age gave. Tom had often afterward
reason to be thankful for that early drilling, and above all
for having mastered Harry Winburn's fall.</p>

<p>Besides their home games, on Saturdays the boys would
wander all over the neighborhood; sometimes to the downs
or up to the camp, where they cut their initials out in the
springy turf, and watched the hawks soaring, and the
"peert" bird, as Harry Winburn called the gray plover,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
gorgeous in his wedding feathers; and so home, racing
down the Manger with many a roll among the thistles, or
through Uffington-wood to watch the fox-cubs playing in
the green rides;<a name="FNanchor_35_233" id="FNanchor_35_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_233" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> sometimes to Rosy Brook, to cut long
whispering reeds which grew there, to make pan-pipes of;
sometimes to Moor Mills, where was a piece of old forest
land, with short browsed turf and tufted brambly thickets
stretching under the oaks, amongst which rumor declared
that a raven,<a name="FNanchor_36_234" id="FNanchor_36_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_234" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> last of his race, still lingered; or to the sand
hills, in vain quest of rabbits; and birds'-nesting, in the
season, anywhere and everywhere.</p>

<h4>EARLIEST PLAYMATES.</h4>

<p>The few neighbors of the Squire's own rank every now
and then would shrug their shoulders as they drove or
rode by a party of boys with Tom in the middle, carrying
along bulrushes or whispering reeds, or great bundles of
cowslip and meadow-sweet, or young starlings or magpies,
or other spoil of wood, brook, or meadow, and Lawyer
Redtape might mutter to Squire Straightback at the
Board, that no good would come of the young Browns, if
they were let run wild with all the dirty village boys,
whom the best farmers' sons even would not play with.
And the Squire might reply with a shake of his head, that
<i>his</i> sons only mixed with their equals, and never went
into the village without a governess or a footman.<a name="FNanchor_37_235" id="FNanchor_37_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_235" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> But,
luckily, Squire Brown was full as stiff-backed as his
neighbors, and so went on his own way; and Tom and his
younger brothers, as they grew up, went on playing with
the village boys, without the idea of equality or inequality
(except in wrestling, running, and climbing) ever entering
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
their heads, as it doesn't till it's put there by over-nice
people or fine ladies' maids.</p>

<p>I don't mean to say it would be the case in all villages,
but it certainly was so in this one; the village boys were
full as manly and honest, and certainly purer than those
in a higher rank; and Tom got more harm from his equals
in his first fortnight at a private school, where he went
when he was nine years old, than he had from his village
friends from the day he left Charity's apron-strings.</p>

<h4>FIRST SCHOOL.</h4>

<p>Great was the grief amongst the village school-boys
when Tom drove off with the Squire, one August morning,
to meet the coach on his way to school. Each of
them had given him some little present of the best that he
had, and his small private box was full of peg-tops, white
marbles (called "alley taws" in the Vale), screws, birds'-eggs,
whipcord, Jews-harps, and other miscellaneous boys'
wealth. Poor Jacob Doodle-calf, in floods of tears, had
pressed upon him, in spluttering earnestness, his lame pet
hedgehog (he had always some poor broken-down beast or
bird by him); but this Tom had been obliged to refuse by
the Squire's order. He had given them all a great tea
under the big elm in their playground, for which Madam
Brown had supplied the biggest cake ever seen in our village;
and Tom was really as sorry to leave them as they
to lose him, but his sorrow was not unmixed with the
pride and excitement of making a new step in life.</p>

<p>And this feeling carried him through his first parting
with his mother better than could have been expected.
Their love was as fair and whole as human love can be,
perfect self-sacrifice on the one side, meeting a young and
true heart on the other. It is not within the scope of my
book, however, to speak of family relations, or I should
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
have much to say on the subject of English mothers,&mdash;ay,
and of English fathers, and sisters, and brothers, too.</p>

<h4>OF PRIVATE SCHOOLS.</h4>

<p>Neither have I room to speak of our private schools;
what I have to say is about public schools,<a name="FNanchor_38_236" id="FNanchor_38_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_236" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> those much-abused
and much-belauded<a name="FNanchor_39_237" id="FNanchor_39_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_237" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> institutions peculiar to England.
So we must hurry through Master Tom's year at a
private school as fast as we can.</p>

<p>It was a fair average specimen, kept by a gentleman,
with another gentleman as second master; but it was little
enough of the real work they did,&mdash;merely coming into
school when lessons were prepared and already to be
heard. The whole discipline of the school out of lesson
hours was in the hands of the two ushers,<a name="FNanchor_40_238" id="FNanchor_40_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_238" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> one of whom
was always with the boys in their playground, in the school,
at meals,&mdash;in fact, at all times and everywhere, till they
were fairly in bed at night.</p>

<p>Now, the theory of private schools is (or was) constant
supervision out of school; therein differing fundamentally
from that of public schools.</p>

<p>It may be right or wrong; but, if right, this supervision
surely ought to be the especial work of the head-master,
the responsible person. The object of all schools is not
to cram Latin and Greek into boys, but to make them
good English boys, good future citizens; and by far the
most important part of that work must be done, or not
done, out of school hours. To leave it, therefore, in the
hands of inferior men, is just giving up the highest and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
hardest part of the work of education. Were I a private
schoolmaster, I should say, let who will hear the boys their
lessons, but let me live with them when they are at play
and rest.</p>

<p>The two ushers in Tom's first school were not gentlemen,
were very poorly educated, and were only driving their
poor trade of usher to get such living as they could out of
it. They were not bad men, but had little heart for their
work, and, of course, were bent on making it as easy as
possible. One of the methods by which they endeavored
to accomplish this was by encouraging tale-bearing, which
had become a frightfully common vice in the school in
consequence, and had sapped all the foundations of school
morality. Another was, by grossly favoring the biggest
boys, who alone could have given them much trouble;
whereby those young gentlemen became most abominable
tyrants, oppressing the little boys in all the small mean
ways which prevail in private schools.</p>

<h4>TOM'S FIRST LETTER HOME.</h4>

<p>Poor little Tom was made dreadfully unhappy in his
first week, by a catastrophe which happened to his first
letter home. With huge labor he had, on the very evening
of his arrival, managed to fill two sides of a sheet of
letter-paper with the assurances of his love for dear
mamma, his happiness at school, and his resolves to do all
she would wish. This missive,<a name="FNanchor_41_239" id="FNanchor_41_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_239" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> with the help of the boy
who sat at the desk next him, also a new arrival, he
managed to fold successfully; but this done they were
sadly put to it for means of sealing. Envelopes were then
unknown, they had no wax, and dared not disturb the
stillness of the evening school-room by getting up and
going to ask the usher for some. At length, Tom's friend,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
being of an ingenious turn of mind, suggested sealing with
ink, and the letter was accordingly stuck down with a blob
of ink, and duly handed by Tom on his way to bed, to the
housekeeper to be posted. It was not till four days afterward
that the good dame sent for him, and produced the
precious letter and some wax saying, "Oh, Master Brown,
I forgot to tell you before, but your letter isn't sealed."
Poor Tom took the wax in silence and sealed his letter,
with a huge lump rising in his throat during the process,
and then ran away to a quiet corner of the playground,
and burst into an agony of tears. The idea of his mother
waiting day after day for the letter he had promised her
at once, and perhaps thinking him forgetful of her, when
he had done all in his power to make good his promise,
was as bitter a grief as any which he had to undergo for
many a long year. His wrath then was proportionately
violent when he was aware of two boys, who stopped close
by him, and one of whom, a fat gaby<a name="FNanchor_42_240" id="FNanchor_42_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_240" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> of a fellow, pointed
at him and called him "Young mammy-sick!" Whereupon
Tom arose, and giving vent thus to his grief and
shame and rage, smote his derider on the nose, and made
it bleed,&mdash;which sent that young worthy howling to the
usher, who reported Tom for violent and unprovoked
assault and battery. Hitting in the face was a felony<a name="FNanchor_43_241" id="FNanchor_43_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_241" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
punishable with flogging, other hitting only a misdemeanor,&mdash;a
distinction not altogether clear in principle. Tom,
however, escaped the penalty by pleading "primum tempus,"<a name="FNanchor_44_242" id="FNanchor_44_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_242" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
and having written a second letter to his mother,
inclosing some forget-me-nots, which he picked on their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
first half-holiday walk, felt quite happy again, and began
to enjoy vastly a good deal of his new life.</p>

<p>These half-holiday walks were the great events of the
week. The whole fifty boys started after dinner with one
of the ushers for Hazeldown, which was distant some mile
or so from the school. Hazeldown measured some three
miles round, and in the neighborhood were several woods
full of all manner of birds and butterflies. The usher
walked slowly round the down with such boys as liked
to accompany him; the rest scattered in all directions,
being only bound to appear again when the usher had
completed his round, and accompany him home. They
were forbidden, however, to go anywhere except on the
down and into the woods; the village had been especially
prohibited, where huge bulls'-eyes<a name="FNanchor_45_243" id="FNanchor_45_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_243" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> and unctuous toffee<a name="FNanchor_46_244" id="FNanchor_46_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_244" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
might be procured in exchange for coin of the realm.</p>

<h4>THE AMUSEMENTS.</h4>

<p>Various were the amusements to which the boys then
betook themselves. At the entrance of the down there
was a steep hillock, like the barrows of Tom's own downs.
This mound was the weekly scene of terrific combats, at
a game called by the queer name of "mud-patties." The
boys who played divided into sides under different leaders,
and one side occupied the mound. Then all parties,
having provided themselves with many sods of turf, cut
with their bread-and-cheese knives, the side which remained
at the bottom proceeded to assault the mound,
advancing upon all sides under cover of a heavy fire of
turfs, and then struggling for victory with the occupants,
which was theirs as soon as they could, even for a moment,
clear the summit, when they in turn became the besieged. It
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
was a good, rough, dirty game, and of great use in counteracting
the sneaking tendencies of the school. Then
others of the boys spread over the downs, looking for the
holes of humble bees<a name="FNanchor_47_245" id="FNanchor_47_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_245" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> and mice, which they dug up without
mercy, often (I regret to say) killing and skinning
the unlucky mice, and (I do not regret to say) getting
well stung by the humble bees. Others went after butterflies
and birds'-eggs in their seasons; and Tom found on
Hazeldown, for the first time, the beautiful little blue
butterfly with golden spots on his wings, which he had
never seen on his own downs, and dug out his first sand-martin's
nest. This latter achievement resulted in a flogging,
for the sand-martins build in a high bank close to the
village, consequently out of bounds;<a name="FNanchor_48_246" id="FNanchor_48_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_246" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> but one of the bolder
spirits of the school, who never could be happy unless he
was doing something to which risk attached, easily persuaded
Tom to break bounds and visit the martin's bank.
From whence, it being only a step to the toffee shop, what
could be more simple than to go on there and fill their
pockets? or what more certain than that on their return,
a distribution of treasure having been made, the usher
should shortly detect the forbidden smell of bulls'-eyes,
and, a search ensuing, discover the state of the breeches'
pockets of Tom and his ally?</p>

<h4>THE REPROBATE.</h4>

<p>This ally of Tom's was indeed a desperate hero in the
sight of the boys, and feared as one who dealt in magic,
or something approaching thereto. Which reputation
came to him in this wise. The boys went to bed at eight,
and, of course, consequently lay awake in the dark for an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
hour or two, telling ghost stories by turns. One night
when it came to his turn, and he had dried up their souls
by his story, he suddenly declared that he would make a
fiery hand appear on the door; and, to the astonishment
and terror of the boys in his room, a hand, or something
like it, in pale light, did then and there appear. The fame
of this exploit having spread to the other rooms, and being
discredited there, the young necromancer<a name="FNanchor_49_247" id="FNanchor_49_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_247" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> declared that
the same wonder would appear in all the rooms in turn,
which it accordingly did; and the whole circumstances
having been privately reported to one of the ushers as
usual, that functionary, after listening about the doors
of the rooms, by a sudden descent caught the performer
in his nightshirt, with a box of phosphorus<a name="FNanchor_50_248" id="FNanchor_50_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_248" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> in his guilty
hand. Lucifer-matches and all the present facilities for
getting acquainted with fire were then unknown: the very
name of phosphorus had something diabolic in it to the
boy mind; so Tom's ally, at the cost of a sound flogging,
earned what many older folks covet much,&mdash;the very
decided fear of most of his companions.</p>

<p>He was a remarkable boy and by no means a bad one.
Tom stuck to him till he left, and got into many scrapes
by so doing. But he was the great opponent of the tale-bearing
habits of the school; and the open enemy of the
ushers; and so worthy of all support.</p>

<p>Tom imbibed a fair amount of Latin and Greek at the
school, but somehow on the whole it didn't suit him, or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
he it, and in the holidays he was constantly working the
Squire to send him at once to a public school. Great was
his joy, then, when in the middle of his third half-year,
in October, 183-, a fever broke out in the village; and
the master having himself slightly sickened of it, the
whole of the boys were sent off at a week's notice to their
respective homes.</p>

<p>The Squire was not quite so pleased as Master Tom to
see that young gentleman's brown, merry face appear at
home, some two months before the proper time, for the
Christmas Holidays; and so, after putting on his thinking-cap,
he retired to his study and wrote several letters, the
result of which was, that one morning at the breakfast-table,
about a fortnight after Tom's return, he addressed
his wife with: "My dear, I have arranged that Tom shall
go to Rugby<a name="FNanchor_51_249" id="FNanchor_51_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_249" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> at once, for the last six weeks of this half-year,
instead of wasting them, riding and loitering about
home. It is very kind of the Doctor<a name="FNanchor_52_250" id="FNanchor_52_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_250" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> to allow it. Will
you see that his things are all ready by Friday, when I
shall take him up to town, and send him down the next
day by himself!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown was prepared for the announcement, and
merely suggested a doubt whether Tom were yet old
enough to travel by himself. However, finding both
father and son against her on this point, she gave in, like
a wise woman, and proceeded to prepare Tom's kit<a name="FNanchor_53_251" id="FNanchor_53_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_251" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> for his
launch into a public school.</p>

<p>"Now, sir, time to get up, if you please. Tally-ho<a name="FNanchor_1_252" id="FNanchor_1_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_252" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
coach for Leicester'll be round in half an hour,
and don't wait for nobody." So spake the Boots<a name="FNanchor_2_253" id="FNanchor_2_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_253" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> of the
Peacock Inn, Islington,<a name="FNanchor_3_254" id="FNanchor_3_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_254" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> at half-past two o'clock on the
morning of a day in the early part of November, 183-,
giving Tom at the same time a shake by the shoulder, and
then putting down a candle and carrying off his shoes to
clean.</p>

<h4>TOM ARRIVES IN TOWN.</h4>

<p>Tom and his father arrived in town from Berkshire the
day before, and finding, on inquiry, that the Birmingham
coaches which ran from the city did not pass through
Rugby, but deposited their passengers at Dunchurch, a
village three miles distant on the main road, where said
passengers had to wait for the Oxford and Leicester coach
in the evening, or to take a post-chaise,<a name="FNanchor_4_255" id="FNanchor_4_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_255" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> had resolved that
Tom should travel down by the Tally-ho, which diverged
from the main road and passed through Rugby itself.
And as the Tally-ho was an early coach, they had driven
out to the Peacock to be on the road.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>
<p>Tom had never been in London, and would have liked
to have stopped at the Belle Sauvage,<a name="FNanchor_5_256" id="FNanchor_5_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_256" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> where they had
been put down by the Star,<a name="FNanchor_6_257" id="FNanchor_6_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_257" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> just at dusk, that he might
have gone roving about those endless, mysterious, gas-lit
streets, which, with their glare and hum and moving
crowds, excited him so that he couldn't talk even. But as
soon as he found that the Peacock arrangement would get
him to Rugby by twelve o'clock in the day, whereas otherwise
he wouldn't be there till the evening, all other plans
melted away; his one absorbing aim being to become a
public-school boy as fast as possible, and six hours sooner
or later seeming to him of the most alarming importance.</p>

<p>Tom and his father had alighted at the Peacock at
about seven in the evening; and having heard with unfeigned
joy the paternal order at the bar, of steaks and
oyster-sauce for supper in half an hour, and seen his
father seated cosily by the bright fire in the coffee-room
with the paper in his hand, Tom had run out to see about
him, had wondered at all the vehicles passing and repassing,
and had fraternized with the boots and hostler,
from whom he ascertained that the Tally-ho was a tip-top
goer, ten miles an hour including stoppages, and so
punctual that all the road set their clocks by her.</p>

<h4>SQUIRE BROWN'S PARTING WORDS.</h4>

<p>Then being summoned to supper, he had regaled himself
in one of the bright little boxes<a name="FNanchor_7_258" id="FNanchor_7_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_258" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> of the Peacock coffee-room,
on the beefsteak and unlimited oyster-sauce; had
at first attended to the excellent advice which his father
was bestowing on him and then begun nodding, from the
united effects of the fire and the lecture. Till the Squire,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
observing Tom's state, and remembering that it was nearly
nine o'clock, and that the Tally-ho left at three, sent the
little fellow off to the chambermaid, with a shake of the
hand (Tom having stipulated in the morning before
starting, that kissing should now cease between them)
and a few parting words.</p>

<p>"And now, Tom, my boy," said the Squire, "remember
you are going, at your own earnest request, to be
chucked into this great school, like a young bear, with
all your troubles before you,&mdash;earlier than we should have
sent you perhaps. If schools are what they were in my
time, you'll see a great many cruel blackguard things
done, and hear a deal of foul bad talk. But never fear.
You tell the truth, keep a brave and kind heart, and
never listen to or say anything you wouldn't have your
mother and sister hear, and you'll never feel ashamed to
come home, or we to see you."</p>

<p>The allusion to his mother made Tom feel rather choky,
and he would have liked to have hugged his father well,
if it hadn't been for the recent stipulation.</p>

<p>As it was, he only squeezed his father's hand, and
looked bravely up and said: "I'll try, father."</p>

<p>"I know you will, my boy. Is your money all safe?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Tom, diving into one pocket to make
sure.</p>

<p>"And your keys," said the Squire.</p>

<p>"All right," said Tom, diving into the other pocket.</p>

<p>"Well, then, good-night. God bless you! I'll tell
Boots to call you, and be up to see you off."</p>

<p>Tom was carried off by the chambermaid in a brown
study,<a name="FNanchor_8_259" id="FNanchor_8_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_259" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> from which he was roused in a clean little attic,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
by that buxom<a name="FNanchor_9_260" id="FNanchor_9_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_260" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> person calling him a little darling, and
kissing him as she left the room; which indignity he was
too much surprised to resent. And still thinking of his
father's last words, and the look with which they were
spoken, he knelt down and prayed that, come what might,
he might never bring shame or sorrow on the dear folk at
home.</p>

<h4>THE SQUIRE'S MEDITATIONS.</h4>

<p>Indeed, the Squire's last words deserved to have their
effect, for they had been the result of much anxious
thought. All the way up to London he had pondered
what he should say to Tom by way of parting advice;
something that the boy could keep in his head ready for
use. By way of assisting meditation, he had even gone
the length of taking out his flint and steel and tinder, and
hammering away for a quarter of an hour till he had
manufactured a light for a long cheroot,<a name="FNanchor_10_261" id="FNanchor_10_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_261" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> which he silently
puffed; to the no small wonder of Coachee, who was an
old friend, and an institution on the Bath road; and who
always expected a talk on the prospects and doings, agricultural
and social, of the whole country when he carried
the Squire.</p>

<p>To condense the Squire's meditation, it was somewhat
as follows: "I won't tell him to read his Bible, and love
and serve God; if he doesn't do that for his mother's
sake and teaching, he won't for mine. Shall I go into
the sort of temptations he'll meet with? No, I can't do
that. Never do for an old fellow to go into such things
with a boy. He won't understand me. Do him more
harm than good, ten to one. Shall I tell him to mind his
work, and say he's sent to school to make himself a good
scholar? Well, but he isn't sent to school for that,&mdash;at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
any rate not for that mainly. I don't care a straw for
Greek particles, or the digamma;<a name="FNanchor_11_262" id="FNanchor_11_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_262" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> no more does his
mother. What is he sent to school for? Well, partly
because he wanted so to go. If he'll only turn out a brave,
helpful, truth-telling Englishman, and a gentleman, and
a Christian, that's all I want," thought the Squire; and
upon this view of the case he framed the last words of advice
to Tom, which were well enough suited to his purpose.</p>

<h4>THE TALLY-HO.</h4>

<p>For they were Tom's first thoughts as he tumbled out
of bed at the summons of Boots, and proceeded rapidly to
wash and dress himself. At ten minutes to three he was
down in the coffee-room in his stockings, carrying his hat-box,
coat, and comforter in his hand, and there he found
his father nursing a bright fire, and a cup of hot coffee
and a hard biscuit<a name="FNanchor_12_263" id="FNanchor_12_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_263" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> on the table.</p>

<p>"Now then, Tom, give us your things here, and drink
this; there's nothing like starting warm, old fellow."</p>

<p>Tom addressed himself to the coffee, and prattled away
while he worked himself into his shoes and his great-coat,
well warmed through,&mdash;a Petersham coat with velvet collar,
made tight after the abominable fashion of those days. And
just as he was swallowing his last mouthful, winding his
comforter round his throat, and tucking the ends into the
breast of his coat, the horn sounds, Boots looks in and
says, "Tally-ho, sir;" and they hear the ring and the rattle
of the four fast trotters and the town-made drag<a name="FNanchor_13_264" id="FNanchor_13_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_264" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> as it
dashes up to the Peacock.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>
<p>"Anything for us, Bob?" says the burly guard,<a name="FNanchor_14_265" id="FNanchor_14_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_265" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> dropping
down from behind, and slapping himself across the
chest.</p>

<p>"Young genl'm'n, Rugby; three parcels, Leicester;
hamper<a name="FNanchor_15_266" id="FNanchor_15_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_266" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> o' game, Rugby"  answers Ostler.</p>

<p>"Tell young gent to look alive," says guard, opening
the hind-boot<a name="FNanchor_16_267" id="FNanchor_16_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_267" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and shooting in the parcels after examining
them by the lamps. "Here, shove the portmanteau<a name="FNanchor_17_268" id="FNanchor_17_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_268" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> up
a-top,&mdash;I'll fasten him presently. Now then, sir, jump up
behind."</p>

<p>"Good-by, father&mdash;my love at home." A last shake of
the hand. Up goes Tom, the guard catching his hat-box
and holding on with one hand, while with the other he
claps the horn to his mouth. Toot, toot, toot! the ostlers
let go their heads, the four bays plunge at the collar, and
away goes the Tally-ho into the darkness, forty-five seconds
from the time they pulled up; Ostler, Boots, and the
Squire stand looking after them under the Peacock lamp.</p>

<p>"Sharp work!" says the Squire, and goes in again to
his bed, the coach being well out of sight and hearing.</p>

<p>Tom stands up on the coach and looks back at his
father's figure as long as he can see it, and then the guard,
having disposed of his luggage, comes to an anchor, and
finishes his buttonings and other preparations for facing
the three hours before dawn; no joke for those who
minded cold, on a fast coach in November, in the reign
of his late majesty.</p>

<h4>A NOVEMBER RIDE IN OLD TIMES.</h4>

<p>I sometimes think that you boys of this generation are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
a deal tenderer fellows than we used to be. At any rate
you are much more comfortable travellers, for I see every
one of you with his rug or plaid,<a name="FNanchor_18_269" id="FNanchor_18_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_269" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and other dodges for
preserving the caloric,<a name="FNanchor_19_270" id="FNanchor_19_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_270" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and most of you going in those
fuzzy, dusty, padded, first-class carriages.<a name="FNanchor_20_271" id="FNanchor_20_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_271" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> It was another
affair altogether, a dark ride on the top of the Tally-ho,
I can tell you, in a tight Petersham coat, and your feet
dangling six inches from the floor. Then you knew what
cold was, and what it was to be without legs, for not a bit
of feeling had you in them after the first half hour. But
it had its pleasures,&mdash;the cold, dark ride. First there was
the consciousness of silent endurance, so dear to every
Englishman,&mdash;of standing out against something, and not
giving in. Then there was the music of the rattling harness,
and the ring of the horses' feet on the hard road, and
the glare of the two bright lamps through the steaming
hoar-frost,<a name="FNanchor_21_272" id="FNanchor_21_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_272" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> over the leader's ears, into the darkness; and
the cheery toot of the guard's horn, to warn some drowsy
pikeman<a name="FNanchor_22_273" id="FNanchor_22_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_273" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> or the ostler at the next change; and the looking
forward to daylight&mdash;and last, but not least, the
delight of returning sensation in your toes.</p>

<p>Then the break of dawn and the sunrise, where can they
be ever seen in perfection but from a coach roof? You
want motion and change and music to see them in their
glory; not the music of singing men and singing women,
but good silent music, which sets itself in your own head,
the accompaniment of work and getting over the ground.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>
<p>The Tally-ho is past St. Albans,<a name="FNanchor_23_274" id="FNanchor_23_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_274" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and Tom is enjoying
the ride, though half frozen. The guard, who is alone
with him on the back of the coach, is silent, but has muffled
Tom's feet up in straw, and put the end of an oat-sack
over his knees. The darkness has driven him inward, and
he has gone over his little past life, and thought of all his
doings and promises, and of his mother and sister, and his
father's last words; and has made fifty good resolutions,
and means to bear himself like a brave Brown as he is,
though a young one. Then he has been forward into the
mysterious boy-future, speculating as to what sort of a
place Rugby is, and what they do there, and calling up all
the stories of public schools which he has heard from big
boys in the holidays. He is chock full of hope and life,
notwithstanding the cold, and kicks his heels against the
backboard, and would like to sing, only he doesn't know
how his friend the silent guard might take it.</p>

<h4>"PULLING UP."</h4>

<p>And now the dawn breaks at the end of the fourth
stage,<a name="FNanchor_24_275" id="FNanchor_24_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_275" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and the coach pulls up at a little road-side inn with
huge stables behind. There is a bright fire gleaming
through the red curtains of the bar-window, and the door
is open. The coachman catches his whip into a double
thong, and throws it to the ostler; the steam of the horses
rises straight up into the air. He has put them along over
the last two miles, and is two minutes before his time.
He rolls down from the box and into the inn. The guard
rolls off behind. "Now, sir," says he to Tom, "you just
jump down, and I'll give you a drop of something to keep
the cold out."</p>

<p>Tom finds a difficulty in jumping, or, indeed, in finding
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
the top of the wheel with his feet, which may be in the
next world, for all he feels; so the guard picks him off
the coach-top, and sets him on his legs, and they stump off
into the bar, and join the coachman and the other outside
passengers.</p>

<p>Here a fresh-looking barmaid serves them each with a
glass of early purl<a name="FNanchor_25_276" id="FNanchor_25_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_276" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> as they stand before the fire, coachman
and guard exchanging business remarks. The purl warms
Tom up and makes him cough.</p>

<p>"Rare tackle<a name="FNanchor_26_277" id="FNanchor_26_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_277" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> that, sir, of a cold morning," says the
coachman, smiling. "Time's up." They are out again
and up; coachee the last, gathering the reins into his
hands and talking to Jem, the ostler, about the mare's
shoulder, and then swinging himself up on to the box,&mdash;the
horses dashing off in a canter before he falls into his
seat. Toot-toot-tootle-too goes the horn, and away they
are again, five-and-thirty miles on their road (nearly half
way to Rugby, thinks Tom), and the prospect of breakfast
at the end of the stage.</p>

<h4>MORNING SIGHTS AND DOINGS.</h4>

<p>And now they begin to see, and the early life of the
country-side comes out: a market cart or two, men in
smock-frocks going to their work, pipe in mouth, a whiff
of which is no bad smell this bright morning. The sun
gets up, and the mist shines like silver gauze. They pass
the hounds jogging along to a distant meet,<a name="FNanchor_27_278" id="FNanchor_27_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_278" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> at the heels
of the huntsman's hack,<a name="FNanchor_28_279" id="FNanchor_28_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_279" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> whose face is about the color of
the tails of his old pink,<a name="FNanchor_29_280" id="FNanchor_29_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_280" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> as he exchanges greetings with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
the coachman and guard. Now they pull up at a lodge,<a name="FNanchor_30_281" id="FNanchor_30_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_281" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
and take on board a well-muffled-up sportsman, with his
gun-case and carpet-bag. An early up-coach meets them
and the coachmen gather up their horses, and pass one
another with the accustomed lift of the elbow, each team
doing eleven miles an hour, with a mile to spare behind,
if necessary. And here comes breakfast.</p>

<p>"Twenty minutes here, gentlemen," says the coachman,
as they pull up at half-past seven at the inn-door.</p>

<h4>BREAKFAST.</h4>

<p>Have we not endured nobly this morning, and is not
this a worthy reward for much endurance? There is the
low dark wainscoted<a name="FNanchor_31_282" id="FNanchor_31_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_282" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> room hung with sporting prints; the
hat-stand (with a whip or two standing up in it belonging
to bagmen,<a name="FNanchor_32_283" id="FNanchor_32_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_283" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> who are still snug in bed) by the door; the
blazing fire, with the quaint old glass over the mantel-piece,
in which is stuck a large card with the lists of the
meets for the week of the county hounds. The table
covered with the whitest of cloths and of china, and bearing
a pigeon pie, ham, round of cold boiled beef cut from
a mammoth ox, and the great loaf of household bread on
a wooden trencher.<a name="FNanchor_33_284" id="FNanchor_33_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_284" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> And here comes in the stout head
waiter, puffing under a tray of hot viands; kidneys and a
steak, transparent rashers<a name="FNanchor_34_285" id="FNanchor_34_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_285" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> and poached eggs, buttered
toast and muffins, coffee and tea all smoking hot. The
table can never hold it all; the cold meats are removed to
the sideboard; they were only put on for show and to give
us an appetite. And now fall on, gentlemen all. It is a
well-known sporting house, and the breakfasts are famous.
Two or three men in pink, on their way to the meet,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
drop in, and are very jovial and sharp-set, as indeed we
all are.</p>

<p>"Tea or coffee, sir?" says head waiter, coming round
to Tom.</p>

<p>"Coffee, please," says Tom with his mouth full of
muffin and kidneys; coffee is a treat to him, tea is not.</p>

<p>Our coachman, I perceive, who breakfasts with us, is a
cold-beef man. He also eschews hot potations, and addicts
himself to a tankard of ale, which is brought him
by the barmaid. Sportsman looks on approvingly, and
orders a ditto for himself.</p>

<p>Tom has eaten kidney and pigeon pie, and imbibed
coffee, till his little skin is as tight as a drum; and then
has the further pleasure of paying head waiter out of his
own purse, in a dignified manner, and walks out before
the inn-door to see the horses put to. This is done
leisurely and in a highly finished manner by the ostlers,
as if they enjoyed the not being hurried. Coachman comes
out with his way-bill,<a name="FNanchor_35_286" id="FNanchor_35_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_286" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> and puffing a fat cigar which the
sportsman has given him. Guard emerges from the tap,<a name="FNanchor_36_287" id="FNanchor_36_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_287" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
where he prefers breakfasting, licking round a tough-looking
doubtful cheroot, which you might tie round your
finger, and three whiffs of which would knock any one
else out of time.</p>

<p>The pinks<a name="FNanchor_37_288" id="FNanchor_37_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_288" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> stand about the inn-door lighting cigars and
waiting to see us start, while their hacks are led up and
down the market-place on which the inn looks. They all
know our sportsman, and we feel a reflected credit when
we see him chatting and laughing with them.</p>

<p>"Now, sir, please," says the coachman; all the rest of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
the passengers are up; the guard is locking up the hind-boot.</p>

<p>"A good run to you," says the sportsman to the pinks,
and is by the coachman's side in no time.</p>

<p>"Let 'em go, Dick!" The ostlers fly back, drawing off
the cloths from their glossy loins, and away we go through
the market-place and down the High Street,<a name="FNanchor_38_289" id="FNanchor_38_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_289" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> looking
in at the first-floor<a name="FNanchor_39_290" id="FNanchor_39_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_290" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> windows, and seeing several worthy
burgesses<a name="FNanchor_40_291" id="FNanchor_40_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_291" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> shaving thereat; while all the shop-boys who
are cleaning the windows, and the house-maids who are
doing the steps, stop and looked pleased as we rattle past,
as if we were a part of their legitimate morning's amusement.
We clear the town, and are well out between the
hedgerows again as the town clock strikes eight.</p>

<h4>GUARD DISCOURSES ON RUGBY.</h4>

<p>The sun shines almost warmly, and breakfast has oiled
all springs and loosened all tongues. Tom is encouraged
by a remark or two of the guard's between the puffs of
his oily cheroot, and besides is getting tired of not talking.
He is too full of his destination to talk about anything
else; and so asks the guard if he knows Rugby.</p>

<p>"Goes through it every day of my life. Twenty minutes
before twelve down&mdash;ten o'clock up."</p>

<p>"What sort of a place is it, please?" says Tom.</p>

<p>Guard looks at him with a comical expression. "Werry
out-o'-the-way place, sir, no paving to streets, nor no lighting.
'Mazin' big horse and cattle fair in autumn&mdash;lasts
a week&mdash;just over now. Takes town a week to get clean
after it. Fairish hunting country. But slow place, sir,
slow place; off the main road, you see&mdash;only three coaches
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
a day, 'an one on 'em a two-oss van,<a name="FNanchor_41_292" id="FNanchor_41_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_292" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> more like a hearse
nor<a name="FNanchor_42_293" id="FNanchor_42_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_293" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> a coach&mdash;Regulator<a name="FNanchor_43_294" id="FNanchor_43_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_294" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>&mdash;comes from Oxford. Young
genl'm'n at school calls her Pig and Whistle, and goes
up to college by her (six miles an hour) when they goes
to enter. Belong to school, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes," says Tom, not unwilling for a moment that the
guard should think him an old boy; but then having
some qualms as to the truth of the assertion, and seeing
that if he were to assume the character of an old boy he
couldn't go on asking the questions he wanted, added&mdash;"that
is to say, I'm on my way there. I'm a new boy."</p>

<p>The guard looked as if he knew this quite as well as
Tom.</p>

<p>"You're werry late, sir," says the guard; "only six
weeks to-day to the end of the half."<a name="FNanchor_44_295" id="FNanchor_44_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_295" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Tom assented.
"We takes up fine loads this day six weeks, and Monday
and Tuesday arter.<a name="FNanchor_45_296" id="FNanchor_45_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_296" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Hopes we shall have the pleasure of
carrying you back."</p>

<p>Tom said he hoped they would; but he thought within
himself that his fate would probably be the Pig and
Whistle.<a name="FNanchor_46_297" id="FNanchor_46_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_297" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<h4>PEA-SHOOTERS.</h4>

<p>"It pays uncommon cert'nly," continues the guard.</p>

<p>"Werry free with their cash is the young genl'm'n. But,
Lor' bless you, we gets into such rows all 'long the road,
what wi' their pea-shooters,<a name="FNanchor_47_298" id="FNanchor_47_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_298" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> and long whips and hollering,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
and upsetting every one as comes by; I'd a sight sooner
carry one or two on 'em, sir, as I may be a carryin' of you
now, than a coach-load."</p>

<p>"What do they do with the pea-shooters?" inquires
Tom.</p>

<p>"Do wi' 'em! why, peppers every one's faces as we
comes near, 'cept the young gals, and breaks windows
wi' them, too, some on 'em shoots so hard. Now 'twas
just here last June, as we was a driving up the first-day
boys,<a name="FNanchor_48_299" id="FNanchor_48_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_299" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> they was mendin' a quarter-mile of road, and there
was a lot of Irish chaps, reg'lar roughs, a breaking stones.
As we comes up, 'Now boys,' says young gent on the box
(smart young fellow, and desper't reckless), 'here's fun!
let the Pats have it about the ears.' 'God's sake, sir,'
says Bob (that's my mate the coachman), 'don't go for to
shoot at 'em, they'll knock us off the coach.' 'Coachee,'
says young my lord, 'you ain't afraid; hoora, boys! let
'em have it.' 'Hoora!' sings out the others, and fill their
mouths chuck full of peas to last the whole line. Bob,
seeing as 'twas to come, knocks his hat over his eyes,
hollers to his 'osses, and shakes 'em up, and away we goes
up to the line on 'em, twenty miles an hour. The Pats
begin to hoora, too, thinking it was a runaway, and first lot
on 'em stands grinnin' and wavin' their old hats as we
comes abreast on 'em; and then you'd ha' laughed to see
how took aback and choking savage they looked, when
they gets the peas a stinging all over 'em. But bless you,
the laugh weren't all of our side, sir, by a long way. We
was going so fast, and they was so took aback, that they
didn't take what was up till we was half-way up the line. Then
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
'twas 'Look out all,' surely. They howls all down
the line fit to frighten you, some on 'em runs arter us and
tries to clamber up behind, only we hits 'em over the
fingers and pulls their hands off; one as had had it very
sharp act'ly<a name="FNanchor_49_300" id="FNanchor_49_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_300" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> runs right at the leaders, as though he'd
ketch 'em by the heads, only luck'ly for him he misses his
tip<a name="FNanchor_50_301" id="FNanchor_50_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_301" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> and comes over a heap o' stones first. The rest picks
up stones, and gives it us right away till we gets out of
shot, the young gents holding out werry manful with the
pea-shooters and such stones as lodged on us, and a pretty
many there was, too. Then Bob picks hisself up again,
and looks at young gent on box werry solemn. Bob'd
had a rum un<a name="FNanchor_51_302" id="FNanchor_51_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_302" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> in the ribs, which'd like to ha' knocked
him off the box, or made him drop the reins. Young
gent on box picks hisself up, and so does we all, and
looks round to count damage. Box's head<a name="FNanchor_52_303" id="FNanchor_52_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_303" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> cut open
and his hat gone; 'nother young gent's hat gone; mine
knocked in at the side, and not one on us as wasn't black
and blue somewheres or another, most on 'em all over.
Two pounds ten to pay for damage to paint, which they
subscribed for there and then, and give Bob and me a
extra half-sovereign each; but I wouldn't go down that
line again not for twenty half-sovereigns." And the guard
shook his head slowly, and got up and blew a clear brisk
toot-toot.</p>

<p>"What fun!" said Tom, who could scarcely contain his
pride at this exploit of his future schoolfellows. He
longed already for the end of the half that he might join
them.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>
<p>"'Tain't such good fun, though, sir, for the folks as
meets the coach, nor for we who has to go back with it
next day. Them Irishers last summer had all got stones
ready for us, and was all but letting drive, and we'd got
two reverend gents aboard, too. We pulled up at the
beginning of the line, and pacified them, and we're never
going to carry no more pea-shooters, unless they promises
not to fire where there is a line of Irish chaps a stone-breaking."
The guard stopped and pulled away at his
cheroot, regarding Tom benignantly the while.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't stop! tell us something more about the pea-shooting."</p>

<h4>AN OLD YEOMAN.</h4>

<p>"Well, there'd like to have been a pretty piece of work
over it at Bicester, a while back. We was six mile from
the town, when we meets an old square-headed gray-haired
yeoman chap, a jogging along quite quiet. He looks up
at the coach, and just then a pea hits him on the nose,
and some catches his cob<a name="FNanchor_53_304" id="FNanchor_53_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_304" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> behind and makes him dance
up on his hind legs. I see'd the old boy's face flush and
look plaguy awkward, and I thought we was in for somethin'
ugly.</p>

<p>"He turns his cob's head, and rides quietly after us,
just out of shot. How that ere cob did step! we never
shook him off not a dozen yards in the six miles. At first
the young gents was werry lively on him: but afore we
got in, seeing how steady the old chap come on, they was
quite quiet, and laid their heads together what they should
do. Some was for fighting, some for axing his pardon.
He rides into the town close after us, comes up when we
stops, and says the two as shot at him must come before
a magistrate; and a great crowd comes round, and we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
couldn't get the 'osses to. But the young uns they all
stand by one another, and says all or none must go, and
as how they'd fight it out, and have to be carried. Just as
'twas gettin' serious, and the old boy and the mob was
going to pull 'em off the coach, one little fellow jumps up
and says: 'Here&mdash;I'll stay&mdash;I'm only going three miles
further. My father's name's Davis, he's known about
here, and I'll go before the magistrate with this gentleman.'
'What! be thee parson Davis's son?' says the old
boy. 'Yes,' says the young un. 'Well, I be mortal sorry
to meet thee in such company, but for thy father's sake
and thine (for thee bi'st<a name="FNanchor_54_305" id="FNanchor_54_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_305" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> a brave young chap) I'll say no
more about it.' Didn't the boys cheer him, and the mob
cheered the young chap&mdash;and then one of the biggest
gets down, and begs his pardon werry gentlemanly for all
the rest, saying as they all had been plaguy vexed from
the first, but didn't like to ax his pardon till then, 'cause
they felt they hadn't ought to shirk the consequences
of their joke. And then they all got down, and shook
hands with the old boy, and asked him to all parts of the
country, to their homes, and we drives off twenty minutes
behind time with cheering and hollering as if we was
county members.<a name="FNanchor_55_306" id="FNanchor_55_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_306" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> But, Lor' bless you, sir," says the
guard smacking his hand down on his knee and looking
full into Tom's face, "ten minutes arter they was all as
bad as ever."</p>

<h4>BLOW-HARD AND HIS YARNS.</h4>

<p>Tom showed such undisguised and open-mouthed interest
in his narrations, that the old guard rubbed up his
memory, and launched out into a graphic history of all
the performances of the boys on the road for the last
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
twenty years. Off the road he couldn't go; the exploit
must have been connected with horses or vehicles to hang
in the old fellow's head. Tom tried him off his own
ground once or twice, but found he knew nothing beyond,
and so let him have his head, and the rest of the road
bowled easily away; for old Blow-hard (as the boys called
him) was a dry old file,<a name="FNanchor_56_307" id="FNanchor_56_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_307" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> with much kindness and humor,
and a capital spinner of a yarn when he had broken the
neck of his day's work, and got plenty of ale under his
belt.</p>

<p>What struck Tom's youthful imagination most, was the
desperate and lawless character of most of the stories.
Was the guard hoaxing him? He couldn't help hoping
that they were true. It's very odd how almost all English
boys love danger; you can get ten to join a game, or climb
a tree, or swim a stream, when there's a chance of breaking
their limbs or getting drowned, for one who'll stay on
level ground, or in his depth, or play quoits or bowls.<a name="FNanchor_57_308" id="FNanchor_57_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_308" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<h4>THE RUNNERS.</h4>

<p>The guard had just finished an account of a desperate
fight which had happened at one of the fairs between the
drovers and the farmers with their whips, and the boys
with cricket-bats and wickets,<a name="FNanchor_58_309" id="FNanchor_58_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_309" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> which arose out of a playful
but objectionable practice of the boys going round to the
public houses and taking the linch-pins out of the wheels
of the gigs, and was moralizing upon the way in which
the Doctor, "a terrible stern man he'd heard tell," had
come down upon several of the performers, "sending
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
three on 'em off next morning, each in a po-chay<a name="FNanchor_59_310" id="FNanchor_59_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_310" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> with
a parish constable," when they turned a corner and neared
the milestone, the third from Rugby. By the stone two boys
stood, their jackets buttoned tight, waiting for the coach.</p>

<p>"Look here, sir," says the guard, after giving a sharp
toot-toot, "there's two on 'em, out and out runners they
be. They comes out about twice or three times a week,
and spurts a mile alongside of us."</p>

<p>And as they came up, sure enough, away went two
boys along the footpath, keeping up with the horses; the
first a light, clean-made fellow going on springs, the other,
stout and round shouldered, laboring in his pace, but
going as dogged as a bull-terrier.</p>

<p>Old Blow-hard looked on admiringly. "See how beautiful
that there un holds hisself together, and goes from
his hips, sir," said he; "he's a 'mazin' fine runner. Now
many coachmen as drives a first-rate team'd put it on and
try and pass 'em. But Bob, sir, bless you, he's tender-hearted;
he'd sooner pull in a bit if he see'd 'em a gettin'
beat. I do b'lieve, too, as that there un'd sooner break his
heart than let us go by him afore next milestone."</p>

<p>At the second milestone the boys pulled up short, and
waved their hats to the guard, who had his watch out and
shouted "4.56," thereby indicating that the mile had been
done in four seconds under the five minutes. They passed
several more parties of boys, all of them objects of the
deepest interest to Tom, and came in sight of the town at
ten minutes before twelve. Tom fetched a long breath,
and thought he had never spent a pleasanter day. Before
he went to bed he had quite settled that it must be the
greatest day he should ever spend, and didn't alter his
opinion for many a long year,&mdash;if he has yet.</p>

<h4>ARRIVAL AT RUGBY.</h4>

<p>"And so here's Rugby, sir, at last, and you'll be in
plenty of time for dinner at the School-house, as I
tell'd you," said the old guard, pulling his horn out of its
case, and tootle-tooing away; while the coachman shook
up his horses, and carried them along the side of the school-close,
round Dead-man's corner, past the school-gates, and
down the High Street to the Spread Eagle; the wheelers
in a spanking trot, and leaders cantering, in a style which
would not have disgraced "Cherry Bob," "ramping, stamping,
tearing, swearing Billy Harwood," or any other of the
old coaching heroes.</p>

<p>Tom's heart beat quick as he passed the great schoolfield
or close, with its noble elms, in which several games
at foot-ball were going on, and tried to take in at once the
long line of gray buildings, beginning with the chapel,
and ending with the School-house, the residence of the
head-master, where the great flag was lazily waving from
the highest round tower. And he began already to be
proud of being a Rugby boy, as he passed the school-gates
with the oriel window<a name="FNanchor_1_311" id="FNanchor_1_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_311" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> above, and saw the boys standing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
there, looking as if the town belonged to them, and nodding
in a familiar manner to the coachman, as if any one
of them would be quite equal to getting on the box and
working the team down the street as well as he.</p>

<h4>TOM FINDS A PATRON.</h4>

<p>One of the young heroes, however, ran out from the
rest, and scrambled up behind; where, having righted
himself, and nodded to the guard, with "How do, Jem?"
he turned short round to Tom, and, after looking him over
for a minute, began:</p>

<p>"I say, you fellow, is your name Brown?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Tom, in considerable astonishment; glad,
however, to have lighted on some one already who seemed
to know him.</p>

<p>"Ah, I thought so; you know my old aunt, Miss East;
she lives somewhere down your way in Berkshire. She
wrote to me that you were coming to-day, and asked me
to give you a lift."<a name="FNanchor_2_312" id="FNanchor_2_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_312" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Tom was somewhat inclined to resent the patronizing
air of his new friend, a boy of just about his own height
and age, but gifted with the most transcendent coolness
and assurance, which Tom felt to be aggravating and
hard to bear, but couldn't for the life of him help admiring
and envying,&mdash;especially when young my lord
begins hectoring two or three long, loafing fellows, half
porter, half stableman, with a strong touch of the blackguard,
and in the end arranges with one of them, nicknamed
Cooey, to carry Tom's luggage up to the School-house
for sixpence.</p>

<p>"And heark'ee, Cooey, it must be up in ten minutes,
or no more jobs from me. Come along, Brown." And
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
away swaggers the young potentate, with his hands in his
pockets, and Tom at his side.</p>

<p>"All right, sir," says Cooey, touching his hat, with a
leer and a wink at his companions.</p>

<p>"Hullo, though!" says East, pulling up, and taking another
look at Tom, "this'll never do. Haven't you got
a hat? We never wear caps here. Only the louts wear
caps. Bless you, if you were to go into the quadrangle<a name="FNanchor_3_313" id="FNanchor_3_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_313" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
with that thing on, I&mdash;don't know what'd happen." The
very idea was quite beyond young Master East, and he
looked unutterable things.</p>

<p>Tom thought his cap a very knowing affair, but confessed
that he had a hat in his hat-box; which was accordingly
at once extracted from the hind-boot, and Tom
equipped in his go-to-meeting roof, as his new friend
called it. But this didn't quite suit his fastidious taste
in another minute, being too shiny; so, as they walk up
the town, they dive into Nixon's, the hatter's, and Tom is
arrayed, to his utter astonishment, and without paying
for it, in a regulation cat-skin<a name="FNanchor_4_314" id="FNanchor_4_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_314" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> at seven and sixpence;
Nixon undertaking to send the best hat up to the matron's
room, School-house, in half an hour.</p>

<p>"You can send in a note for a tile<a name="FNanchor_5_315" id="FNanchor_5_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_315" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> on Monday, and
make it all right, you know," said the Mentor.<a name="FNanchor_6_316" id="FNanchor_6_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_316" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> "We're
allowed two seven-and-sixers a half, besides what we bring
from home."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>
<p>Tom by this time began to be conscious of his new social
position and dignities, and to luxuriate in the realized
ambition of being a public-school boy at last, with a vested
right of spoiling two seven-and-sixers in half a year.<a name="FNanchor_7_317" id="FNanchor_7_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_317" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>"You see," said his friend, as they strolled up toward
the school-gates, in explanation of his conduct, "a great
deal depends on how a fellow cuts up at first. If he's got
nothing odd about him, and answers straightforward, and
holds his head up, he gets on. Now you'll do very well
as to rig, all but that cap. You see I'm doing the handsome
thing by you, because my father knows yours; besides,
I want to please the old lady. She gave me half-a-sov.<a name="FNanchor_8_318" id="FNanchor_8_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_318" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
this half, and perhaps'll double it next, if I keep in
her good books."<a name="FNanchor_9_319" id="FNanchor_9_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_319" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>There's nothing for candor like a lower-school boy, and
East was a genuine specimen,&mdash;frank, hearty and good-natured,
well satisfied with himself and his position, and
chock full of life and spirits, and all the Rugby prejudices
and traditions which he had been able to get together in
the long course of one-half year during which he had been
at the School-house.</p>

<p>And Tom, notwithstanding his bumptiousness,<a name="FNanchor_10_320" id="FNanchor_10_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_320" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> felt
friends with him at once, and began sucking in all his
ways and prejudices, as fast as he could understand them.</p>

<h4>INTRODUCTION TO THE MATRON.</h4>

<p>East was great in the character of cicerone;<a name="FNanchor_11_321" id="FNanchor_11_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_321" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> he carried
Tom through the great gates, where were only two or
three boys. These satisfied themselves with the stock
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
questions&mdash;"You fellow, what's your name? Where do
you come from? How old are you? Where do you board?
and, What form<a name="FNanchor_12_322" id="FNanchor_12_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_322" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> are you in?"&mdash;and so they passed on
through the quadrangle and a small court-yard, upon
which looked down a lot of little windows (belonging, as
his guide informed him, to some of the School-house studies),<a name="FNanchor_13_323" id="FNanchor_13_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_323" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
into the matron's room, where East introduced Tom
to that dignitary; made him give up the key of his trunk,
that the matron might unpack his linen, and told the story
of the hat and of his own presence of mind; upon the relation
whereof the matron laughingly scolded him, for the
coolest new boy in the house; and East, indignant at the
accusation of newness, marched Tom off into the quadrangle,
and began showing him the schools, and examining
him as to his literary attainments; the result of which was
a prophecy that they would be in the same form, and could
do their lessons together.</p>

<h4>EAST'S STUDY.</h4>

<p>"And now come in and see my study; we shall have
just time before dinner; and afterward, before calling-over,<a name="FNanchor_14_324" id="FNanchor_14_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_324" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
we'll do the close."</p>

<p>Tom followed his guide through the School-house hall,
which opens into the quadrangle. It is a great room,
thirty feet long and eighteen high, or thereabouts, with
two great tables running the whole length, and two large
fire-places at the side, with blazing fires in them, at one of
which some dozen boys were standing and lounging, some
of whom shouted to East to stop; but he shot through
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
with his convoy,<a name="FNanchor_15_325" id="FNanchor_15_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_325" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and landed him in the long dark passages,
with a large fire at the end of each, upon which the
studies opened. Into one of these, in the bottom passage,
East bolted with our hero, slamming and bolting the door
behind them, in case of pursuit from the hall, and Tom
was for the first time in a Rugby boy's citadel.</p>

<p>He hadn't been prepared for separate studies, and was
not a little astonished and delighted with the palace in
question.</p>

<p>It wasn't very large certainly, being about six feet long
by four broad. It couldn't be called light, as there were
bars and a grating to the window; which little precautions
were necessary in the studies on the ground-floor looking
out into the close, to prevent the exit of small boys after
locking up, and the entrance of contraband articles. But
it was uncommonly comfortable to look at, Tom thought.
The space under the window at the further end was occupied
by a square table covered with a reasonably clean
and whole red and blue check table-cloth; a hard-seated
sofa covered with red stuff occupied one side, running up
to the end and making a seat for one, or by sitting close,
for two at the table; and a good stout wooden chair
afforded a seat to another boy, so that three could sit and
work together. The walls were wainscoted half-way up,
the wainscot being covered with green baize, the remainder
with a bright-patterned paper, on which hung three or four
prints, of dog's heads, Grimaldi<a name="FNanchor_16_326" id="FNanchor_16_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_326" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> winning the Aylesbury
steeple-chase,<a name="FNanchor_17_327" id="FNanchor_17_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_327" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Amy Robsart,<a name="FNanchor_18_328" id="FNanchor_18_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_328" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> the reigning Waverley
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
beauty of the day, and Tom Crib<a name="FNanchor_19_329" id="FNanchor_19_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_329" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> in a posture of defence,
which did no credit to the science<a name="FNanchor_20_330" id="FNanchor_20_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_330" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> of that hero, if
truly represented. Over the door was a row of hat-pegs,
and on each side book-cases with cupboards at the bottom;
shelves and cupboards being filled indiscriminately with
school-books, a cup or two, a mouse-trap, and candlesticks,
leather straps, a fustian bag, and some curious-looking
articles which puzzled Tom not a little, until his friend
explained that they were climbing irons, and showed their
use. A cricket-bat and small fishing-rod stood up in one
corner.</p>

<h4>"OUR OWN" AND THE USE THEREOF.</h4>

<p>This was the residence of East and another boy in the
same form, and had more interest for Tom than Windsor
Castle,<a name="FNanchor_21_331" id="FNanchor_21_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_331" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> or any other residence in the British Isles. For
was he not about to become the joint owner of a similar
home, the first place he could call his own? One's own,&mdash;what
a charm there is in the words! How long it takes
boy and man to find out their worth! how fast most of us
hold on to them! faster and more jealously, the nearer we
are to that general home, into which we can take nothing,
but must go naked as we came into the world. When
shall we learn that he who multiplieth possessions multiplieth
troubles, and that the one single use of things which
we call our own is that they may be his who hath need
of them?</p>

<p>"And shall I have a study like this, too?" said Tom.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course, you'll be chummed with some fellow
on Monday, and you can sit here till then."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>
<p>"What nice places!"</p>

<p>"They're well enough," answered East, patronizingly,
"only uncommon cold at nights sometimes. Gower&mdash;that's
my chum&mdash;and I make a fire with paper on the
floor after supper generally, only that makes it so
smoky."</p>

<p>"But there's a big fire out in the passage," said Tom.</p>

<p>"Precious little we get out of that though," said East;
"Jones the pr&aelig;postor<a name="FNanchor_22_332" id="FNanchor_22_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_332" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> has the study at the fire end, and
he has rigged up an iron rod and green baize curtains
across the passage, which he draws at night, and sits there
with his door open, so he gets all the fire, and hears if we
come out of our studies after eight, or make a noise.
However, he's taken to sitting in the fifth-form room
lately, so we do get a bit of fire now sometimes; only
keep a sharp look-out that he don't catch you behind his
curtain when he comes down,&mdash;that's all."</p>

<h4>TOM'S FIRST RUGBY DINNER.</h4>

<p>A quarter past one now struck, and the bell began tolling
for dinner, so they went into the hall and took their
places, Tom at the very bottom of the second table, next
to the pr&aelig;postor (who sat at the end to keep order there),
and East a few paces higher. And now Tom for the first
time saw his future school-fellows in a body. In they
came, some hot and ruddy from foot-ball or long walks,
some pale and chilly from hard reading<a name="FNanchor_23_333" id="FNanchor_23_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_333" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> in their studies,
some from loitering over the fire at the pastry-cook's,
dainty mortals, bringing with them pickles and sauce-bottles
to help them with their dinners. And a great big-bearded
man, whom Tom took for a master, began calling
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
over the names, while the great joints were being rapidly
carved on the third table in the corner by the old verger<a name="FNanchor_24_334" id="FNanchor_24_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_334" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
and the housekeeper. Tom's turn came last, and meanwhile
he was all eyes, looking first with awe at the great
man who sat close to him, and was helped first, and who
read a hard-looking book all the time he was eating: and
when he got up and walked off to the fire, at the small
boys round him, some of whom were reading, and the rest
talking in whispers to one another, or stealing one another's
bread, or shooting pellets,<a name="FNanchor_25_335" id="FNanchor_25_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_335" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> or digging their forks through
the table-cloth. However, notwithstanding his curiosity,
he managed to make a capital dinner by the time the big
man called "Stand up!" and said grace.</p>

<p>As soon as dinner was over, and Tom had been questioned
by such neighbors as were curious as to his birth,
parentage, education, and other like matters, East, who
evidently enjoyed his new dignity of patron and Mentor,
proposed having a look at the close,<a name="FNanchor_26_336" id="FNanchor_26_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_336" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> which Tom, athirst
for knowledge, gladly assented to, and they went out
through the quadrangle and passed the fives' court,<a name="FNanchor_27_337" id="FNanchor_27_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_337" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> into
the great play-ground.</p>

<p>"That's the chapel you see," said East, "and there just
behind it is the place for fights; you see it's most out of
the way of the masters, who all live on the other side and
don't come by here after the first lesson or callings-over.
That's when the fights come off. And all this part where
we are is the little side-ground, right up to the trees, and
on the other side of the trees is the big side-ground, where
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
the great matches are played. And there's the island<a name="FNanchor_28_338" id="FNanchor_28_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_338" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> in
the farthest corner; you'll know that well enough next
half, when there's island fagging.<a name="FNanchor_29_339" id="FNanchor_29_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_339" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> I say, it's horrid cold!
let's have a run across;" and away went East, Tom close
behind him. East was evidently putting his best foot
foremost, and Tom, who was mighty proud of his running,
and not a little anxious to show his friend that although
a new boy he was no milk-sop, laid himself down to the
work in his very best style. Right across the close they
went, each doing all he knew, and there wasn't a yard
between them, when they pulled up at the island-moat.</p>

<p>"I say," said East, as soon as he got his wind, looking
with much increased respect at Tom, "you aren't a bad
scud, not by no means. Well, I'm warm as toast now."</p>

<h4>WHITE TROUSERS IN NOVEMBER.</h4>

<p>"But why do you wear white trousers in November?"
said Tom. He had been struck by this peculiarity in the
costume of almost all the School-house boys.</p>

<p>"Why, bless us, don't you know?&mdash;No, I forgot. Why,
to-day's the School-house match. Our house plays the
whole of the School at foot-ball.<a name="FNanchor_30_340" id="FNanchor_30_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_340" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> And we all wear white
trousers to show 'em we don't care for hacks.<a name="FNanchor_31_341" id="FNanchor_31_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_341" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> You're in
luck to come to-day. You just will see a match; and
Brooke's going to let me play in quarters. That's more
than he'll do for any other lower-school boy, except James,
and he is fourteen."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>
<p>"Who is Brooke?"</p>

<p>"Why, that big fellow who called over at dinner, to be
sure. He's cock of the school, and head of the School-house
side, and the best kick and charger in Rugby."</p>

<p>"Oh, but do show me where they play. And tell me
about it. I love foot-ball so, and have played all my life.
Won't Brooke let me play?"</p>

<p>"Not he," said East, with some indignation; "why,
you don't know the rules,&mdash;you'll be a month learning
them. And then it's no joke playing-up, in a match, I
can tell you. Quite another thing from your private
school games. Why, there's been two collar-bones broken
this half, and a dozen fellows lamed. And last year a
fellow had his leg broken."</p>

<p>Tom listened with the profoundest respect to this chapter
of accidents, and followed East across the level ground
till they came to a sort of gigantic gallows of two poles
eighteen feet high, fixed upright in the ground some fourteen
feet apart, with a cross-bar running from one to the
other at the height of ten feet or thereabouts.</p>

<h4>EAST DISCOURSETH ON FOOT-BALL.</h4>

<p>"This is one of the goals," said East, "and you see
the other across there, right opposite, under the Doctor's
wall. Well, the match is for the best of three goals;
whichever side kicks two goals wins: and it won't do, you
see, just to kick the ball through these posts, it must go
over the cross-bar; any height'll do, so long as it's between
the posts. You'll have to stay in goal to touch the
ball when it rolls behind the posts, because if the other
side touch it they have a try at goal. Then we fellows in
quarters, we play just about in front of goal here, and
have to turn the ball and kick it back before the big
fellows on the other side can follow it up. And in front
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
of us all the big fellows play, and that's where the scrummages
are mostly."</p>

<p>Tom's respect increased as he struggled to make out
his friend's technicalities,<a name="FNanchor_32_342" id="FNanchor_32_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_342" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> and the other set to work to
explain the mysteries of "off your side," "drop-kicks,"
"punts," "places," and the other intricacies of the great
science of foot-ball.</p>

<p>"But how do you keep the ball between the goals?"
said he; "I can't see why it mightn't go right down to
the chapel."</p>

<p>"Why, that's out of play," answered East. "You see
this gravel walk running down all along this side of the
playing-ground, and the line of elms opposite on the
other? Well, they're the bounds. As soon as the ball
gets past them, it's in touch, and out of play. And then
whoever first touches it, has to knock it straight out
amongst the players-up, who make two lines with a space
between them, every fellow going on his own side. Aren't
there just fine scrummages then! and the three trees you
see there which come out into the play, that's a tremendous
place when the ball hangs there, for you get thrown
against the trees, and that's worse than any hack."</p>

<p>Tom wondered within himself, as they strolled back
again towards the fives' court, whether the matches were
really such break-neck affairs as East represented, and
whether, if they were, he should ever get to like them and
play-up well.</p>

<h4>CALLING-OVER.</h4>

<p>He hadn't long to wonder, however, for the next minute
East cried out: "Hurra; here's the punt-about&mdash;come
along and try your hand at a kick." The punt-about
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
is the practice-ball, which is just brought out and
kicked about anyhow from one boy to another before callings-over
and dinner, and at other odd times. They
joined the boys who had brought it out, all small School-house
fellows, friends of East; and Tom had the pleasure
of trying his skill, and performed very creditably, after
first driving his foot three inches into the ground, and
then nearly kicking his leg into the air, in vigorous efforts
to accomplish a drop-kick after the manner of East.</p>

<p>Presently more boys and bigger came out, and boys
from other houses on their way to callings-over, and more
balls were sent for. The crowd thickened as three o'clock
approached; and when the hour struck, one hundred and
fifty boys were hard at work. Then the balls were held,
the master of the week came down in cap and gown<a name="FNanchor_33_343" id="FNanchor_33_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_343" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> to
calling-over, and the whole school of three hundred boys
swept into the Big School<a name="FNanchor_34_344" id="FNanchor_34_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_344" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> to answer to their names.</p>

<p>"I may come in, mayn't I?" said Tom, catching East
by the arm and longing to feel one of them.</p>

<p>"Yes, come along, nobody'll say anything. You won't
be so eager to get into calling-over after a month," replied
his friend; and they marched into the Big School together,
and up to the further end, where that illustrious form, the
lower fourth, which had the honor of East's patronage
for the time-being, stood.</p>

<p>The master mounted into the high desk by the door,
and one of the pr&aelig;postors of the week stood by him on
the steps, the other three marching up and down the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
middle of the school with their canes,<a name="FNanchor_35_345" id="FNanchor_35_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_345" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> calling out "Silence,
silence!" The sixth form stood close by the door on the
left, some thirty in number, mostly great, big, grown men,
as Tom thought, surveying them from a distance with
awe. The fifth form behind them, twice their number,
and not quite so big. These on the left; and on the right
the lower fifth, shell,<a name="FNanchor_36_346" id="FNanchor_36_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_346" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> and all the junior forms in order;
while up the middle marched the three pr&aelig;postors.</p>

<p>Then the pr&aelig;postor who stands by the master calls out
the names, beginning with the sixth form; and as he calls,
each boy answers "here" to his name, and walks out.
Some of the sixth stop at the door to turn the whole string
of boys into the close; it is a great match day, and every
boy in the school will-he, nill-he,<a name="FNanchor_37_347" id="FNanchor_37_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_347" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> must be there. The rest
of the sixth go forward into the close, to see that no one
escapes by any of the side gates.</p>

<h4>"THEY TRUST TO OUR HONOR."</h4>

<p>To-day, however, being the School-house match, none
of the School-house pr&aelig;postors stay by the door to watch
for truants of their side; there is <i>carte blanche</i><a name="FNanchor_38_348" id="FNanchor_38_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_348" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> to the
School-house fags to go where they like: "They trust to
our honor," as East proudly informs Tom; "they know
very well that no School-house boy would cut the match.<a name="FNanchor_39_349" id="FNanchor_39_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_349" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
If he did, we'd very soon cut him,<a name="FNanchor_40_350" id="FNanchor_40_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_350" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> I can tell you."</p>

<p>The master of the week being short-sighted, and the
pr&aelig;postors of the week small, and not well up to their
work, the lower-school boys employ the ten minutes which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
elapse before their names are called, in pelting one another
vigorously with acorns, which fly about in all directions.
The small pr&aelig;postors dash in every now and then, and
generally chastise some quiet, timid boy, who is equally
afraid of acorns and canes, while the principal performers
get dexterously out of the way; and so calling-over rolls
on somehow, much like the big world, punishments lighting
on wrong shoulders, and matters going generally in a
queer, cross-grained way, but the end coming somehow,
which is after all the great point. And now the master of
the week has finished, and locked up the Big School; and
the pr&aelig;postors of the week come out, sweeping the last
remnant of the School fags,&mdash;who had been loafing about
the corners, by the fives' court, in hopes of a chance of
bolting before them, into the close.</p>

<p>"Hold the punt-about!" "To the goals!" are the cries,
and all stray balls are impounded<a name="FNanchor_41_351" id="FNanchor_41_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_351" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> by the authorities; and
the whole mass of boys move up toward the two goals,
dividing as they go into three bodies. That little band on
the left, consisting of from fifteen to twenty boys, Tom
amongst them, who are making for the goal under the
School-house wall, are the School-house boys who are not
to play-up, and have to stay in goal. The larger body
moving to the island goal are the School boys in a like predicament.
The great mass in the middle are the players-up,
both sides mingled together; they are hanging their
jackets, and all who mean real work, their hats, waistcoats,
neck-handkerchiefs, and braces,<a name="FNanchor_42_352" id="FNanchor_42_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_352" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> on the railings round the
small trees; and there they go by twos and threes up to
their respective grounds. There is none of the color and
tastiness of get up, you will perceive, which lends such a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
life to the present game at Rugby, making the dullest and
worst fought match a pretty sight. Now, each house has
its own uniform of cap and jersey, of some lively color;
but at the time we are speaking of, plush caps had not yet
come in, or uniforms of any sort, except the School-house
white trousers, which are abominably cold to-day; let us
get to work, bare-headed and girded with our plain leather
strap,&mdash;but we mean business, gentlemen.</p>

<h4>OLD BROOKE'S GENERALSHIP.</h4>

<p>And now that the two sides have fairly sundered, and
each occupies its own ground, and we get a good look at
them, what absurdity is this? You don't mean to say
that those fifty or sixty boys, in white trousers, many of
them quite small, are going to play that huge mass opposite?
Indeed I do, gentlemen; they're going to try, at
any rate, and won't make such a bad fight of it either,
mark my word: for hasn't old Brooke won the toss, with
his lucky half-penny, and got choice of goals and kick-off?
The new ball you may see lie there quite by itself, in the
middle, pointing toward the School or island goal; in
another minute it will be well on its way there. Use that
minute in remarking how the School-house side is drilled.
You will see, in the first place, that the sixth form boy
who has charge of goal has spread his force (the goal-keepers)
so as to occupy the whole space behind the goal-posts
at distances of about five yards apart; a safe and
well-kept goal is the foundation of all good play. Old
Brooke is talking to the captain of quarters; and now he
moves away. See how that youngster spreads his men
(the light brigade) carefully over the ground, half-way
between their own goal and the body of their own players-up
(the heavy brigade). These again play in several bodies;
there is young Brooke and the bull dogs&mdash;mark them
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
well&mdash;they are the "fighting brigade," the "die-hards,"
larking<a name="FNanchor_43_353" id="FNanchor_43_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_353" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> about at leap-frog to keep themselves warm, and
playing tricks on one another. And on each side of old
Brooke, who is now standing in the middle of the ground
and just going to kick-off, you see a separate wing of
players-up, each with a boy of acknowledged prowess to
look to&mdash;here Warner, and there Hedge; but over all is
old Brooke, absolute as he of Russia,<a name="FNanchor_44_354" id="FNanchor_44_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_354" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> but wisely and
bravely ruling over willing and worshipping subjects, a
true foot-ball king. His face is earnest and careful as he
glances a last time over his array, but full of pluck and
hope; the sort of look I hope to see in my general when I
go out to fight.</p>

<p>The School side is not organized in the same way. The
goal-keepers are all in lumps, anyhow and nohow; you
can't distinguish between the players-up and the boys in
quarters, and there is divided leadership; but with such
odds in strength and weight, it must take more than that
to hinder them from winning; and so their leaders seem
to think, for they let the players-up manage themselves.</p>

<h4>A SCRUMMAGE.</h4>

<p>But now look; there is a slight move forward of the
School-house wings; a shout of "Are you ready?" and
loud affirmative reply. Old Brooke takes half a dozen
quick steps, and away goes the ball spinning toward the
School goal; seventy yards before it touches ground, and
at no point above twelve or fifteen feet high, a model kick-off;
and the School-house cheer and rush on; the ball is
returned, and they meet it and drive it back amongst the
masses of the School already in motion. Then the two
sides close, and you can see nothing for minutes but a
swaying crowd of boys, at one point violently agitated. That
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
is where the ball is, and there are the keen players
to be met, and the glory and the hard knocks to be got.
You hear the dull thud of the ball, and the shouts of
"Off your side," "Down with him," "Put him over,"
"Bravo." This is what we call "a scrummage," gentlemen,
and the first scrummage in a School-house match
was no joke in the consulship of Plancus.<a name="FNanchor_45_355" id="FNanchor_45_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_355" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>But see! it has broken; the ball is driven out on the
School-house side, and a rush of the School carries it past
the School-house players-up. "Look out in quarters,"
Brooke's and twenty other voices ring out. No need to
call, though; the School-house captain of quarters has
caught it on the bound, dodges the foremost School-boys
who are heading the rush, and sends it back with a good
drop-kick well into the enemy's country. And then follows
rush upon rush, and scrummage upon scrummage,
the ball now driven through into the School-house quarters,
and now into the School goal; for the School-house
have not lost the advantage which the kick-off and a
slight wind gave them at the outset, and are slightly
"penning" their adversaries. You say you don't see
much in it all; nothing but a struggling mass of boys, and
a leathern ball, which seems to excite them all to great
fury, as a red rag does a bull. My dear sir, a battle would
look much the same to you, except that the boys would be
men, and the balls iron; but a battle would be worth
your looking at, for all that, and so is a foot-ball match.
You can't be expected to appreciate the delicate strokes
of play, the turns by which a game is lost and won; it
takes an old player to do that, but the broad philosophy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
of foot-ball you can understand if you will. Come along
with me a little nearer, and let us consider it together.</p>

<h4>HOW TO GO IN.</h4>

<p>The ball has just fallen again where the two sides are
thickest, and they close rapidly around it in a scrummage;
it must be driven through now by force or skill, till it flies
out on one side or the other. Look how differently the
boys face it! Here come two of the bull-dogs, bursting
through the outsiders; in they go, straight to the heart of
the scrummage, bent on driving that ball out on the opposite
side. That is what they mean to do. My sons, my
sons! you are too hot; you have gone past the ball, and
must struggle now right through the scrummage, and get
round and back again to your own side before you can be
of any further use. Here comes young Brooke; he goes
in as straight as you, but he keeps his head, and backs and
bends, holding himself still behind the ball, and driving
it furiously when he gets the chance. Take a leaf out of
his book, you young chargers. Here comes Speedicut and
Flashman, the School-house bully, with shouts and great
action. Won't you two come up to young Brooke, after
locking up, by the School-house fire, with "Old fellow,
wasn't that just a splendid scrummage by the three trees!"
But he knows you and so do we. You don't really want
to drive that ball through that scrummage, chancing all
hurt for the glory of the School-house&mdash;but to make us
think that's what you want&mdash;a vastly different thing;
and fellows of your sort will never go through more than
the skirts of a scrummage, where it's all push and no
kicking. We respect boys who keep out of it, and don't
sham going in; but you&mdash;we had rather not say what we
think of you.</p>

<p>Then the boys who are bending and watching on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
outside, mark them&mdash;they are most useful players, the
dodgers; who seize on the ball the moment it rolls out
from amongst the chargers, and away with it across to the
opposite goal; they seldom go into the scrummage, but
must have more coolness than the chargers; as endless as
are boys' characters, so are their ways of facing or not
facing a scrummage at foot-ball.</p>

<h4>YOUNG BROOKE'S RUSH.</h4>

<p>Three quarters of an hour are gone; first winds are
failing, and weight and numbers beginning to tell. Yard
by yard the School-house have been driven back, contesting
every inch of ground. The bull-dogs are the color of
mother earth from shoulder to ankle, except young Brooke,
who has a marvellous knack of keeping his legs. The
School-house are being penned in their turn, and now
the ball is behind their goal, under the Doctor's wall. The
Doctor and some of his family are there looking on, and
seem as anxious as any boy for the success of the School-house.
We get a minute's breathing time before old
Brooke kicks out, and he gives the word to play strongly
for touch, by the three trees. Away goes the ball, and
the bull-dogs after it, and in another minute there is a
shout of "In touch," "Our ball." Now's your time, old
Brooke, while your men are still fresh. He stands with
the ball in his hand, while the two sides form in deep lines
opposite one another; he must strike it straight out
between them. The lines are thickest close to him, but
young Brooke and two or three of his men are shifting up
further, where the opposite line is weak. Old Brooke
strikes it out straight and strong, and it falls opposite his
brother. Hurra! that rush has taken it right through
the School line, and away past the three trees, far into
their quarters, and young Brooke and the bull-dogs are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
close upon it. The School leaders rush back, shouting
"Look out in goal!" and strain every nerve to catch him,
but they are after the fleetest foot in Rugby. There they
go straight for the School goal-posts, quarters scattering
before them. One after another the bull-dogs go down,
but young Brooke holds on. "He is down," No! a long
stagger, but the danger is past; that was the shock of
Crew, the most dangerous of dodgers. And now he is
close to the School goal, the ball not three yards before
him. There is a hurried rush of the School fags to the
spot, but no one throws himself on the ball, the only
chance, and young Brooke has touched it right under the
School goal-post.</p>

<p>The School leaders come up furious, and administer
toco<a name="FNanchor_46_356" id="FNanchor_46_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_356" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> to the wretched fags nearest at hand; they may well
be angry, for it is all Lombard Street<a name="FNanchor_47_357" id="FNanchor_47_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_357" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> to a China orange<a name="FNanchor_48_358" id="FNanchor_48_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_358" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
that the School-house kick a goal with the ball touched
in such a good place. Old Brooke, of course, will kick it
out, but who shall catch and place it? Call Crab Jones.
Here he comes, sauntering along with a straw in his
mouth, the queerest, coolest fish in Rugby; if he were
tumbled into the moon this minute, he would just pick
himself up without taking his hands out of his pockets or
turning a hair. But it is a moment when the boldest
charger's heart beats quick. Old Brooke stands with the
ball under his arm motioning the School back; he will not
kick out till they are all in goal, behind the posts; they
are all edging forward, inch by inch, to get nearer for the
rush at Crab Jones, who stands there in front of old
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
Brooke to catch the ball. If they can reach and destroy
him before he catches, the danger is over; and with one
and the same rush they will carry it right away to the
School-house goal. Fond<a name="FNanchor_49_359" id="FNanchor_49_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_359" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> hope! it is kicked out and
caught beautifully. Crab strikes his heel into the ground,
to mark the spot where the ball was caught, beyond which
the School line may not advance; but there they stand,
five deep, ready to rush the moment the ball touches the
ground. Take plenty of room! don't give the rush a
chance of reaching you! place it true and steady! Trust
Crab Jones&mdash;he has made a small hole with his heel for
the ball to lie on, by which he is resting on one knee, with
his eye on old Brooke. "Now!" Crab places the ball at
the word, old Brooke kicks, and it rises slowly and truly
as the School rush forward.</p>

<h4>A GOAL.</h4>

<p>Then a moment's pause, while both sides look up at the
spinning ball. There it flies, straight between the two
posts, some five feet above the cross-bar, an unquestioned
goal; and a shout of real genuine joy rings out from the
School-house players-up, and a faint echo of it comes over
the close from the goal-keepers under the Doctor's wall.
A goal in the first hour&mdash;such a thing hasn't been done
in the School-house match these five years.</p>

<p>"Over!" is the cry; the two sides change goals, and
the School-house goal-keepers come threading their way
across through the masses of the School; the most openly
triumphant of them, amongst whom is Tom, a School-house
boy of two hours' standing, getting their ears boxed
in the transit. Tom, indeed, is excited beyond measure,
and it is all the sixth-form boy, kindest and safest of goal-keepers,
has been able to do, to keep him from rushing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
out whenever the ball has been near their goal. So he
holds him by his side, and instructs him in the science of
touching.</p>

<p>At this moment Griffith, the itinerant<a name="FNanchor_50_360" id="FNanchor_50_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_360" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> vender of
oranges from Hill Morton, enters the close with his
heavy baskets; there is a rush of small boys upon the little
pale-faced man, the two sides mingling together, subdued
by the great Goddess Thirst, like the English and French
by the streams in the Pyrenees.<a name="FNanchor_51_361" id="FNanchor_51_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_361" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> The leaders are past
oranges and apples, but some of them visit their coats,
and apply innocent-looking ginger-beer bottles to their
mouths. It is no ginger-beer though, I fear, and will do
you no good. One short, mad rush, and then a stitch in
the side, and no more honest play; that's what comes of
those bottles.</p>

<p>But now Griffith's baskets are empty, the ball is placed
again midway, and the School are going to kick-off.
Their leaders have sent their lumber into goal, and rated
the rest soundly, and one hundred and twenty picked
players-up are there, bent on retrieving the game. They
are to keep the ball in front of the School-house goal, and
then to drive it in by sheer strength and weight. They
mean heavy play and no mistake, and so old Brooke sees;
and places Crab Jones in quarters just before the goal,
with four or five picked players, who are to keep the ball
away to the sides, where a try at goal, if obtained, will be
less dangerous than in front. He, himself, and Warner
and Hedge, who have saved themselves until now, will
lead the charges.</p>

<h4>"ARE YOU READY?"</h4>

<p>"Are you ready?" "Yes." And away comes the ball
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
kicked high in the air, to give the School time to rush on
and catch it as it falls. And here they are amongst us.
Meet them like Englishmen, you School-house boys, and
charge them home. Now is the time to show what mettle
is in you&mdash;and there shall be a warm seat by the hall fire,
and honor to-night for him who does his duty in the next
half-hour. And they are well met. Again and again the
cloud of their players-up gathers before our goal, and comes
threatening on, and Warner or Hedge, with young Brooke
and the relics of the bull-dogs, break through and carry
the ball back; and old Brooke ranges the field like Job's
war-horse; the thickest scrummage parts asunder before
his rush, like the waves before a clipper's bows; his cheery
voice rings over the field, and his eye is everywhere. And
if these miss the ball, and it rolls dangerously in front of
our goal, Crab Jones and his men have seized it, and sent
it away towards the sides with the unerring drop-kick.
This is worth living for; the whole sum of school-boy
existence gathered up into one straining, struggling half-hour,
a half-hour worth a year of common life.</p>

<h4>EAST'S CHARGE.</h4>

<p>The quarter to five has struck, and the play slackens
for a minute before goal; but there is Crew, the artful
dodger, driving the ball in behind our goal, on the island
side, where our quarters are weakest. Is there no one to
meet him? Yes, look at little East! the ball is just at
equal distances between the two, and they rush together,
the young man of seventeen, and the boy of twelve, and
kick it at the same moment. Crew passes on without a
stagger; East is hurled forward by the shock, and plunges
on his shoulder, as if he would bury himself in the ground;
but the ball rises straight into the air, and falls behind
Crew's back, while the "bravos" of the School-house
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
attest the pluckiest charge of all that hard-fought day.
Warner picks East up lame and half-stunned, and he
hobbles back into goal, conscious of having played the
man.</p>

<p>And now the last minutes are come, and the School
gather for their last rush, every boy of the hundred and
twenty who has a run left in him. Reckless of the defence
of their own goal, on they come across the level big-side
ground, the ball well down amongst them, straight
for our goal, like the column of the Old Guard up the
slope at Waterloo.<a name="FNanchor_52_362" id="FNanchor_52_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_362" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> All former charges have been child's
play to this. Warner and Hedge have met them, but
still on they come. The bull-dogs rush in for the last
time; they are hurled over or carried back, striving hand,
foot, and eyelids. Old Brooke comes sweeping round the
skirts of the play, and, turning short round, picks out the
very heart of the scrummage, and plunges in. It wavers
for a moment&mdash;he has the ball! No, it has passed him,
and his voice rings out clear over the advancing tide:
"Look out in the goal." Crab Jones catches it for a
moment; but before he can kick, the rush is upon him
and passes over him; and he picks himself up behind them
with his straw in his mouth, a little dirtier, but as cool as
ever.</p>

<p>The ball rolls slowly in behind the School-house goal,
not three yards in front of a dozen of the biggest School
players-up.</p>

<h4>TOM'S FIRST EXPLOIT.</h4>

<p>There stands the School-house pr&aelig;postor, safest of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
goal-keepers, and Tom Brown by his side, who has learned his
trade by this time. Now is your time, Tom. The blood
of all the Browns is up, and the two rush in together, and
throw themselves on the ball, under the very feet of the
advancing column; the pr&aelig;postor on his hands and knees
arching his back, and Tom all along on his face. Over
them topple the leaders of the rush, shooting over the
back of the pr&aelig;postor, but falling flat on Tom, and knocking
all the wind out of his small carcass. "Our ball,"
says the pr&aelig;postor, rising with his prize, "but get up
there, there's a little fellow under you." They are
hauled and roll off him, and Tom is discovered a motionless
body.</p>

<p>Old Brooke picks him up. "Stand back, give him air,"
he says; and then, feeling his limbs, adds, "No bones
broken. How do you feel, young un?"</p>

<p>"Hah-hah!" gasps Tom, as his wind comes back,
"pretty well, thank you&mdash;all right."</p>

<p>"Who is he?" says Brooke.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's Brown, he's a new boy; I know him," says
East, coming up.</p>

<p>"Well, he is a plucky youngster, and will make a
player," says Brooke.</p>

<p>And five o'clock strikes. "No side"<a name="FNanchor_53_363" id="FNanchor_53_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_363" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> is called, and the
first day of the School-house match is over.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>AFTER THE MATCH.</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"&mdash;&mdash;Some food we had."&mdash;<i>Shakespeare.</i></p>

<p>[Greek: "&ecirc;s potos hadus."]&mdash;<i>Theocr., Id.</i></p>
</div>

<h4>CELEBRATING THE VICTORY.</h4>

<p>As the boys scattered away from the ground, and East,
leaning on Tom's arm and limping along, was beginning
to consider what luxury they should go and buy for tea
to celebrate that glorious victory, the two Brookes came
striding by. Old Brooke caught sight of East and stopped,
put his hand kindly on his shoulder, and said, "Bravo,
youngster! you played famously. Not much the matter,
I hope?"</p>

<p>"No, nothing at all," said East; "only a little twist
from that charge."</p>

<p>"Well, mind and get all right for next Saturday;"
and the leader passed on, leaving East better for those few
words than all the opodeldoc<a name="FNanchor_1_364" id="FNanchor_1_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_364" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> in England would have made
him, and Tom ready to give one of his ears for as much
notice. Ah! light words of those whom we love and
honor, what a power ye are, and how carelessly wielded
by those who can use them! Surely for these things, also,
God will ask an account.</p>

<p>"Tea's directly after locking-up, you see," said East,
hobbling along as fast as he could, "so you come along
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
down to Sally Harrowell's; that's our School-house tuck-shop,<a name="FNanchor_2_365" id="FNanchor_2_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_365" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>&mdash;she
bakes such stunning murphies, we'll have a
penn'orth each for tea; come along, or they'll all be
gone."</p>

<p>Tom's new purse and money burnt in his pocket; he
wondered, as they toddled through the quadrangle and
along the street, whether East would be insulted if he
suggested further extravagance, as he had not sufficient
faith in a pennyworth of potatoes. At last he blurted
out,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I say, East, can't we get something else besides potatoes?
I've got lots of money, you know."</p>

<p>"Bless us, yes, I forgot," said East, "you've only just
come. You see all my tin's been gone this twelve
weeks; it hardly ever lasts beyond the first fortnight;
and our allowances were all stopped this morning for
broken windows, so I haven't got a penny. I've got a
tick<a name="FNanchor_3_366" id="FNanchor_3_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_366" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> at Sally's of course; but then I hate running it high,
you see, towards the end of the half, 'cause one has to
shell out for it all directly one comes back, and that's a
bore."<a name="FNanchor_4_367" id="FNanchor_4_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_367" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Tom didn't understand much of this talk, but seized on
the fact that East had no money, and was denying himself
some little pet luxury in consequence. "Well, what shall
I buy?" said he; "I'm uncommon hungry."</p>

<p>"I say," said East, stopping to look at him and rest his
leg, "you're a trump, Brown. I'll do the same by you
next half. Let's have a pound of sausages, then; that's
the best grub for tea I know of."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Tom, as pleased as possible; "where
do they sell them?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>
<p>"Oh, over here, just opposite;" and they crossed the
street and walked into the cleanest little front room of a
small house, half parlor, half shop, and bought a pound
of most particular sausages; East talking pleasantly to
Mrs. Porter while she put them in paper, and Tom doing
the paying part.</p>

<h4>HARROWELL'S.</h4>

<p>From Porter's they adjourned to Sally Harrowell's,
where they found a lot of School-house boys waiting for
the roast potatoes, and relating their own exploits in the
day's match at the top of their voices. The street opened
at once into Sally's kitchen, a low bricked-floored room,
with large recess for fire, and chimney-corner seats. Poor
little Sally, the most good-natured and much enduring of
woman-kind, was bustling about with the napkin in her
hand, from her own oven to those of the neighbors' cottages,
up the yard at the back of the house. Stumps,
her husband, a short easy-going shoemaker, with a beery,
humorous eye and ponderous calves, who lived mostly on
his wife's earnings, stood in a corner of the room, exchanging
shots of the roughest description of repartee
with every boy in turn. "Stumps, you lout, you've had
too much beer again to-day." "'Twasn't of your paying
for, then." "Stumps's calves are running down into his
ankles; they want to get to grass." "Better be doing
that, than gone altogether like yours," etc., etc. Very
poor stuff it was, but it served to make time pass; and
every now and then Sally arrived in the middle with a
smoking tin of potatoes, which was cleared off in a few
seconds, each boy as he seized his lot running off to the
house with "Put me down two-penn'orth, Sally;" "Put
down three penn'orth between me and Davis," etc. How
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
she ever kept the accounts so straight as she did, in her
head and on her slate, was a perfect wonder.</p>

<p>East and Tom got served at last, and started back for
the School-house just as the locking-up bell began to ring;
East on the way recounting the life and adventures of
Stumps, who was a character. Amongst his other small
avocations, he was the hind carrier of a sedan-chair,<a name="FNanchor_5_368" id="FNanchor_5_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_368" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> the
last of its race, in which the Rugby ladies still went out
to tea, and in which, when he was fairly harnessed and
carrying a load, it was the delight of small and mischievous
boys to follow him and whip his calves. This was
too much for the temper even of Stumps, and he would
pursue his tormentors in a vindictive and apoplectic manner
when released, but was easily pacified by twopence to
buy beer with.</p>

<h4>TEA AND ITS LUXURIES.</h4>

<p>The lower-school boys of the School-house, some fifteen
in number, had tea in the lower-fifth school, and were
presided over by the old verger or head-porter. Each boy
had a quarter of a loaf of bread and pat of butter, and as
much tea as he pleased; and there was scarcely one who
didn't add to this some further luxury, such as baked
potatoes, a herring, sprats, or something of the sort; but
few, at this period of the half-year, could live up to a
pound of Porter's sausages, and East was in great magnificence
upon the strength of theirs. He had produced a
toasting-fork from his study, and set Tom to toast the
sausages, while he mounted guard over their butter and
potatoes; "'cause," as he explained, "you're a new boy,
and they'll play you some trick and get our butter, but
you can toast just as well as I." So Tom, in the midst of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
three or four more urchins similarly employed, toasted his
face and the sausages at the same time before the huge
fire, till the latter cracked, when East from his watch-tower
shouted that they were done, and then the feast
proceeded, and the festive cups of tea were filled and
emptied, and Tom imparted of the sausages in small bits
to many neighbors, and thought he had never tasted such
good potatoes or seen such jolly boys. They on their
part waived all ceremony, and pegged away at the sausages
and potatoes, and, remembering Tom's performance
in goal, voted East's new crony a brick. After tea, and
while the things were being cleared away, they gathered
round the fire, and the talk on the match still went on;
and those who had them to show, pulled up their trousers
and showed the hacks they had received in the good
cause.</p>

<p>They were soon however all turned out of the School,
and East conducted Tom up to his bedroom, that he might
get on clean things and wash himself before singing.</p>

<p>"What singing?" said Tom, taking his head out of his
basin, where he had been plunging it in cold water.</p>

<p>"Well, you are jolly green," answered his friend from
a neighboring basin. "Why, the last six Saturdays of
every half, we sing, of course, and this is the first of them.
No first lesson to do, you know, and lie in bed to-morrow
morning."</p>

<p>"But who sings?"</p>

<p>"Why, everybody, of course; you'll see soon enough.
We begin directly after supper, and sing till bed-time. It
isn't such good fun now though as in the summer half,
'cause then we sing in the little fives' court, under the
library you know, and we cut about the quadrangle
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
between the songs, and it looks like a lot of robbers in a
cave. And the louts<a name="FNanchor_6_369" id="FNanchor_6_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_369" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> come and pound at the great gate,
and we pound back again, and shout at them. But this half
we only sing in the hall. Come along down to my study."</p>

<p>Their principal employment in the study was to clear
out East's table, removing the drawers and ornaments and
table-cloth; for he lived in the bottom passage, and his
table was in requisition for the singing.</p>

<h4>SUPPER.</h4>

<p>Supper came in due course at seven o'clock, consisting
of bread and cheese and beer, which was all saved for the
singing; and directly afterward the fags went to work to
prepare the hall. The School-house hall, as has been said,
is a great long high room, with two large fires on one
side, and two large iron-bound tables, one running down
the middle, and the other along the wall opposite the fire-places.
Around the upper fire the fags placed the tables
in the form of a horse-shoe, and upon them the jugs<a name="FNanchor_7_370" id="FNanchor_7_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_370" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> with
the Saturday night's allowance of beer. Then the big
boys used to drop in and take their seats, bringing their
song-books with them; for although they all knew the
songs by heart, it was the thing to have an old manuscript
book descended from some departed hero, in which
they were all carefully written out.</p>

<p>The sixth-form boys had not yet appeared; so to fill up
the gap, an interesting and time-honored ceremony was
gone through. Each new boy was placed on the table
in turn, and made to sing a solo, under the penalty of
drinking a large mug of salt and water, if he resisted or
broke down. However, the new boys all sing like nightingales
to-night, and the salt water is not in requisition;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
Tom, as his part, performing the old west-country song of
"The Leather Bott&egrave;l," with considerable applause. And
at the half-hour down come the sixth and fifth-form boys,
and take their places at the tables, which are filled up by
the next biggest boys; the rest, for whom there is no room
at the table, standing round outside.</p>

<h4>BROOKE'S HONORS.</h4>

<p>The glasses and mugs are filled, and then the fugle-man<a name="FNanchor_8_371" id="FNanchor_8_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_371" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
strikes up the old sea song:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><p>
"A wet sheet and a flowing sea,<br />
And a wind that follows fast," etc.,<br />
</p></div>

<p>which is the invariable first song in the School-house, and
all the seventy voices join in, not mindful of harmony, but
bent on noise, which they attain decidedly, but the
general effect isn't bad. And then follow the "British
Grenadiers," "Billie Taylor," "The Siege of Seringapatam,"
"Three Jolly Post-boys," and other vociferous
songs in rapid succession, including the "Chesapeake and
Shannon,"<a name="FNanchor_9_372" id="FNanchor_9_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_372" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> a song lately introduced in honor of old
Brooke; and when they come to the words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><p>
"Brave Broke he waved his sword, crying, Now, my lads, aboard,<br />
And we'll stop their playing Yankee-doodle-dandy, oh,"<br />
</p></div>

<p>you expect the roof to come down. The sixth and fifth
know that "brave Broke" of the Shannon was no sort of
relation to our old Brooke. The fourth form are uncertain
in their belief, but for the most part hold that old
Brooke <i>was</i> a midshipman then on board his uncle's ship. And
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
the lower-school never doubt for a moment that it
was our old Brooke who led the boarders, in what capacity
they care not a straw.</p>

<p>Then Warner, the head of the house, gets up and wants
to speak, but he can't, for every boy knows what's coming;
and the big boys who sit at the tables pound them and
cheer; and the small boys who stand behind pound one
another and cheer, and rush about the hall cheering.
Then silence being made, Warner reminds them of the
old School-house custom of drinking the healths, on the
first night of singing, of those who are going to leave at
the end of the half. He sees that they know what he is
going to say already&mdash;(loud cheers)&mdash;and so won't keep
them, but only ask them to treat the toast as it deserves.</p>

<p>"It is the head of the eleven, the head of big-side foot-ball,
their leader on this glorious day&mdash;Pater<a name="FNanchor_10_373" id="FNanchor_10_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_373" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Brooke!"</p>

<h4>BROOKE DISCOURSETH ON UNION.</h4>

<p>And away goes the pounding and cheering again, becoming
deafening when old Brooke gets on his legs; till,
a table having broken down, and all throats getting dry,
silence ensues, and the hero speaks, leaning his hands on
the table, and bending a little forward. No action, no
tricks of oratory; plain, strong, and straight, like his play.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen of the School-house! I am very proud of
the way in which you have received my name, and I wish
I could say all I should like in return. But I know I
sha'n't. However, I'll do the best I can to say what seems
to me ought to be said by a fellow who's just going to
leave, and who has spent a good slice of his life here.
Eight years, it is, and eight such years as I can never hope
to have again. So now I hope you'll all listen to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
me&mdash;(loud cheers of "that we will")&mdash;for I am going to talk
seriously. You're bound to listen to me, for what's the
use of calling me 'pater,' and all that, if you don't mind
what I say? And I am going to talk seriously, because I
feel so. It's a jolly time, too, getting to the end of the
half, and a goal kicked by us first day&mdash;(tremendous applause)&mdash;after
one of the hardest and fiercest day's play I
can remember in eight years&mdash;(frantic shoutings). The
School played splendidly, too, I will say, and kept it up
to the last. That last charge of theirs would have carried
away a house. I never thought to see anything again of
old Crab there, except little pieces, when I saw him
tumbled over by it&mdash;(laughter and shouting, and great
slapping on the back of Jones by the boys nearest him).
Well, but we beat 'em&mdash;(cheers). Ay, but why did we
beat 'em? answer me that&mdash;(shouts of "your play").
Nonsense! 'Twasn't the wind and kick-off either&mdash;that
wouldn't do it. 'Twasn't because we've half a dozen of
the best players in the School, as we have. I wouldn't
change Warner, and Hedge, and Crab, and the young un,
for any six on their side&mdash;(violent cheers). But half a
dozen fellows can't keep it up for two hours against two
hundred. Why is it, then? I'll tell you what I think.
Its because we've more reliance on one another, more of
a house feeling, more fellowship than the School can have.
Each of us knows and can depend on his next-hand man
better&mdash;that's why we beat 'em to-day. We've union,
they've division&mdash;there's the secret&mdash;(cheers). But how's
this to be kept up? How's it to be improved? That's
the question. For I take it, we're all in earnest about
beating the School, whatever else we care about. I
know I'd sooner win two School-house matches
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
running than get the Balliol scholarship<a name="FNanchor_11_374" id="FNanchor_11_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_374" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> any day&mdash;(frantic
cheers).</p>

<p>"Now, I'm as proud of the house as any one. I believe
it's the best house in the School, out-and-out&mdash;(cheers).
But it's a long way from what I want to see it. First,
there's a deal of bullying going on. I know it well. I
don't pry about and interfere; that only makes it more
underhand, and encourages the small boys to come to us
with their fingers in their eyes telling tales, and so we
should be worse off than ever. It's very little kindness
for the sixth to meddle generally&mdash;you youngsters, mind
that. You'll be all the better foot-ball players for learning
to stand it, and to take your own parts, and fight it
through. But depend on it, there's nothing breaks up a
house like bullying. Bullies are cowards, and one coward
makes many; so good-by to the School-house match if
bullying gets ahead here. (Loud applause from the small
boys, who look meaningly at Flashman and other boys at
the tables.) Then there's fuddling about in the public-houses,
and drinking bad spirits, and punch, and such
wretched stuff. That won't make good drop-kicks or
chargers of you, take my word for it; and drinking isn't
fine or manly, whatever some of you may think of it.</p>

<p>"One other thing I must have a word about. A lot of
you think and say, for I've heard you, 'there's this new
Doctor<a name="FNanchor_12_375" id="FNanchor_12_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_375" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> hasn't been here so long as some of us, and he's
changing all the old customs. Rugby, and the School-house
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
especially, are going to the dogs. Stand up for the
good old ways, and down with the Doctor!' Now, I'm
as fond of old Rugby customs and ways as any of you,
and I've been here longer than any of you, and I'll give
you a word of advice in time, for I shouldn't like to see
any of you getting sacked. 'Down with the Doctor,' is
easier said than done. You'll find him pretty tight on his
perch, I take it, and an awkwardish customer to handle
in that line. Besides, now, what customs has he put
down? There was the good old custom of taking the
linch-pins out of the farmers' and bagmen's gigs at the
fairs, and a cowardly blackguard custom it was. We all
know what came of it, and no wonder the Doctor objected
to it. But, come now, any of you, name a custom that
he has put down."</p>

<p>"The hounds," calls out a fifth-form boy, clad in a green
cutaway with brass buttons and cord trousers, the leader
of the sporting interest, and reputed a great rider and a
keen hand generally.</p>

<p>"Well, we had six or seven mangy harriers and beagles<a name="FNanchor_13_376" id="FNanchor_13_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_376" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
belonging to the house, I'll allow, and had had them for
years, and the Doctor put them down. But what good
ever came of them? Only rows with all the keepers<a name="FNanchor_14_377" id="FNanchor_14_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_377" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> for
ten miles round; and big-side Hare and Hounds<a name="FNanchor_15_378" id="FNanchor_15_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_378" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> is better
fun ten times over. What else?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>
<p>No answer.</p>

<h4>STANDETH UP FOR "THE DOCTOR."</h4>

<p>"Well, I won't go on. Think it over for yourselves;
you'll find, I believe, that he doesn't meddle with any one
that's worth keeping. And mind now, I say again, look
out for squalls, if you will go your own way, and that way
isn't the Doctor's, for it'll lead to grief. You all know
that I am not the fellow to back a master through thick
and thin. If I saw him stopping foot-ball, or cricket, or
bathing, or sparring,<a name="FNanchor_16_379" id="FNanchor_16_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_379" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> I'd be as ready as any fellow to stand
up about it. But he doesn't&mdash;he encourages them. Didn't
you see him put to-day for half an hour watching us?&mdash;(loud
cheers for the Doctor)&mdash;and he's a strong true man,
and a wise one too, and a public-school man too. (Cheers.)
And so let's stick to him, and talk no more stuff, and
drink his health as the head of the house. (Loud cheers.)
And now I have done blowing up, and very glad I am
to have done. But it's a solemn thing to be thinking of
leaving a place which one has lived in and loved for eight
years; and if one can say a word for the good of the old
house at such a time, why, it should be said, whether bitter
or sweet. If I hadn't been proud of the house and you&mdash;ay,
no one knows how proud&mdash;I shouldn't be blowing you
up. And now let's get to singing. But before I sit down
I must give you a toast, to be drunk with three-times-three
and all the honors. It's a toast which I hope every one of
us, wherever he may go hereafter, will never fail to drink
when he thinks of the brave bright days of his boyhood.
It's a toast which should bind us all together, and to those
who've gone before, and who'll come after us here. It is
the dear old School-house&mdash;the best house of the best
School in England!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>
<h4>SCHOOL IDOLATRIES.</h4>

<p>My dear boys, old and young, you who have belonged,
or do belong, to other schools and other houses, don't
begin throwing my poor little book about the room, and
abusing me and it, and vowing you'll read no more when
you get to this point. I allow you've provocation for it.
But, come now&mdash;would you, any of you, give a fig for a
fellow who didn't believe in, and stand up for, his own
house and his own school? You know you wouldn't.
Then don't object to my cracking up the old School-house,
Rugby. Haven't I a right to do it, when I'm taking all
the trouble of writing this true history for all of your
benefits? If you aren't satisfied, go and write the history
of your own houses in your own times, and say all you
know for your own schools and houses, provided it's true,
and I'll read it without abusing you.</p>

<p>The last few words hit the audience in their weakest
place; they had been not altogether enthusiastic at several
parts of old Brooke's speech; but "the best house of the
best School of England," was too much for them all, and
carried even the sporting and drinking interests off their
legs into rapturous applause, and (it is to be hoped) resolutions
to lead a new life and remember old Brooke's
words; which, however, they didn't altogether do, as will
appear hereafter.</p>

<p>But it required all old Brooke's popularity to carry
down parts of his speech: especially that relating to the
Doctor. For there are no such bigoted holders by established
forms and customs, be they never so foolish or
meaningless, as English schoolboys, at least the schoolboys
of our generation. We magnified into heroes every
boy who had left, and looked upon him with awe and
reverence, when he revisited the place a year or so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
afterwards, on his way to or from Oxford or Cambridge; and
happy was the boy who remembered him, and sure of an
audience as he expounded what he used to do and say,
though it were sad enough stuff to make angels, not to
say head-masters, weep.</p>

<h4>"THE DOCTOR" AND HIS WORKS.</h4>

<p>We looked upon every trumpery little custom and habit
which had obtained in the School as though it had been a
law of the Medes and Persians,<a name="FNanchor_17_380" id="FNanchor_17_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_380" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and regarded the infringement
or variation of it a sort of sacrilege. And the Doctor,
than whom no man or boy had a stronger liking for old
school customs, which were good and sensible, had, as has
already been hinted, come into most decided collision with
several which were neither the one nor the other. And as
old Brooke had said, when he came into collision with boys
or customs, there was nothing for them but to give in or
take themselves off; because what he said had to be done,
and no mistake about it. And this was beginning to be
pretty clearly understood; the boys felt that there was a
strong man over them, who would have things his own
way; and hadn't yet learned that he was a wise and loving
man also. His personal character and influence had not
had time to make itself felt, except by a very few of the
bigger boys with whom he came more directly in contact;
and he was looked upon with great fear and dislike by the
great majority even of his own house. For he had found
School and School-house in a state of monstrous license and
misrule, and was still employed in the necessary but unpopular
work of setting up order with a strong hand.</p>

<p>However, as has been said, old Brooke triumphed, and
the boys cheered him, and then the Doctor. And then
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
more songs came, and the healths of the other boys about
to leave, who each made a speech, one flowery, another
maudlin,<a name="FNanchor_18_381" id="FNanchor_18_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_381" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> a third prosy, and so on, which are not necessary
to be here recorded.</p>

<p>Half-past nine struck in the middle of the performance
of "Auld Lang Syne," a most obstreperous proceeding;
during which there was an immense amount of standing
with one foot on the table, knocking mugs together and
shaking hands, without which accompaniments it seems
impossible for the youth of Britain to take part in that
famous old song. The under-porter of the School-house
entered during the performance, bearing five or six long
wooden candlesticks, with lighted dips<a name="FNanchor_19_382" id="FNanchor_19_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_382" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> in them, which he
proceeded to stick into their holes in such part of the great
tables as he could get at; and then stood outside the ring
till the end of the song, when he was hailed with shouts.</p>

<p>"Bill, you old muff,<a name="FNanchor_20_383" id="FNanchor_20_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_383" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> the half-hour hasn't struck."</p>

<p>"Sing us a song, old boy." "Don't you wish you may
get the table?"</p>

<p>Bill remonstrated: "Now, gentlemen, there's only ten
minutes to prayers, and we must get the hall straight."</p>

<p>Shouts of "No, no!" and a violent effort to strike up
"Billie Taylor" for the third time. Bill looked appealingly
to old Brooke, who got up and stopped the noise.
"Now, then, lend a hand, you youngsters, and get the
tables back, clear away the jugs<a name="FNanchor_21_384" id="FNanchor_21_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_384" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and glasses. Bill's right.
Open the windows, Warner." The boy addressed, who
sat by the long ropes, proceeded to pull up the great windows,
and let in a clear fresh rush of night air, which made
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
the candles flicker and gutter and the fires roar. The
circle broke up, each collaring his own jug, glass, and
song-book; Bill pounced on the big table, and began to
rattle it away to its place outside the buttery-door. The
lower-passage boys carried off their small tables, aided by
their friends, while above all, standing on the great hall
table, a knot of untiring sons of harmony made night doleful
by a prolonged performance of "God save the King."
His Majesty King William IV.<a name="FNanchor_22_385" id="FNanchor_22_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_385" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> then reigned over us, a
monarch deservedly popular amongst the boys addicted to
melody, to whom he was chiefly known from the beginning
of that excellent, if slightly vulgar song in which they
much delighted:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><p>
"Come, neighbors all, both great and small,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perform your duties here,<br />
And loudly sing 'live Billy our King,'<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; For bating<a name="FNanchor_23_386" id="FNanchor_23_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_386" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> the tax upon beer."
</p></div>

<h4>LAST LOYAL STRAINS.</h4>

<p>Others of the more learned in songs also celebrated his
praises in a sort of ballad, which I take to have been written
by some Irish loyalists. I have forgotten all but the
chorus, which ran:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><p>
"God save our good King William, be his name forever blest,<br />
He's the father of all his people, and the guardian of all the rest."
</p></div>

<p>In truth we were loyal subjects in those days, in a rough
way. I trust that our successors make as much of her
present majesty, and, having regard to the greater refinement
of the times, have adopted or written other songs
equally hearty, but more civilized, in her honor.</p>

<h4>PRAYERS.</h4>

<p>Then the quarter to ten struck, and the prayer-bell
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
rang. The sixth and fifth form boys ranged themselves
in their school order along the wall, on either side of the
great fires, the middle fifth and upper-school boys around
the long table in the middle of the hall, and the lower-school
boys round the upper part of the second long table,
which ran down the side of the hall furthest from the
fires. Here Tom found himself at the bottom of all, in a
state of mind and body not at all fit for prayers, as he
thought; and so tried hard to make himself serious, but
couldn't for the life of him do anything but repeat in his
head the choruses of some of the songs, and stare at all the
boys opposite, wondering at the brilliancy of their waistcoats,
and speculating what sort of fellows they were. The
steps of the head-porter are heard on the stairs, and a light
gleams at the door. "Hush!" from the fifth-form boys
who stand there, and then in strides the Doctor, cap on
head, book in one hand, and gathering up his gown in the
other. He walks up the middle, and takes his post by
Warner, who begins calling over the names. The Doctor
takes no notice of anything, but quietly turns over his
book, and finds the place, and then stands, cap in hand,
and finger in book, looking straight before his nose. He
knows better than any one when to look, and when to see
nothing; to-night is singing-night, and there's been lots of
noise and no harm done. So the Doctor sees nothing, but
fascinates Tom in a horrible manner, as he stands there,
and reads out the Psalm in that deep, ringing, searching
voice of his. Prayers are over, and Tom still stares open-mouthed
after the Doctor's retiring figure, when he feels a
pull at his sleeve, and turning round, sees East.</p>

<h4>TOSSING.</h4>

<p>"I say, were you ever tossed in a blanket?"</p>

<p>"No," said Tom; "why?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>
<p>"'Cause there'll be tossing to-night, most likely, before
the sixth come up to bed. So if you funk,<a name="FNanchor_24_387" id="FNanchor_24_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_387" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> you just come
along and hide, or else they'll catch you and toss you."</p>

<p>"Were you ever tossed? Does it hurt," inquired Tom.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, bless you, a dozen times," said East, as he
hobbled along by Tom's side up-stairs. "It doesn't hurt
unless you fall on the floor. But most fellows don't
like it."</p>

<p>They stopped at the fire-place in the top passage, where
were a crowd of small boys whispering together, and evidently
unwilling to go up into the bedrooms. In a minute,
however, a study door opened, and a sixth-form boy came
out, and off they all scuttled up the stairs, and then noiselessly
dispersed to their different rooms. Tom's heart
beat rather quick as he and East reached their room, but
he had made up his mind.</p>

<p>"I sha'n't hide, East," said he.</p>

<p>"Very well, old fellow!" replied East, evidently pleased;
"no more shall I&mdash;they'll be here for us directly."</p>

<p>The room was a great big one, with a dozen beds in it,
but not a boy that Tom could see, except East and himself.
East pulled off his coat and waistcoat, and then sat
on the bottom of the bed, whistling, and pulling off his
boots. Tom followed his example.</p>

<p>A noise and steps are heard in the passage, the door
opens, and in rush four or five great fifth-form boys, headed
by Flashman in his glory.</p>

<p>Tom and East slept in the further corner of the room,
and were not seen at first.</p>

<p>"Gone to ground, eh?" roared Flashman; "push 'em
out then, boys! look under the beds;" and he pulled up the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
little white curtain of the one nearest him. "Who-o-op,"
he roared, pulling away at the leg of a small boy, who
held on tight to the leg of the bed, and sung out lustily
for mercy.</p>

<p>"Here, lend a hand, one of you, and help me pull out
this young howling brute. Hold your tongue, sir, or I'll
kill you!"</p>

<p>"Oh, please, Flashman, please, Walker, don't toss me!
I'll fag for you, I'll do anything, only don't toss me."</p>

<p>"You be hanged," said Flashman, lugging the wretched
boy along, "'twon't hurt you,&mdash;&mdash;you! Come along!
boys, here he is."</p>

<p>"I say Flashey," sung out another one of the big boys,
"drop that; you heard what old Pater Brooke said to-night.
I'll be hanged if we'll toss any one against his will&mdash;no
more bullying. Let him go, I say."</p>

<p>Flashman, with an oath and a kick, released his prey,
who rushed headlong under his bed again, for fear they
should change their minds, and crept along underneath
the other beds, till he got under that of the sixth-form boy,
which he knew they daren't disturb.</p>

<h4>EAST AND TOM DEVOTE THEMSELVES.</h4>

<p>"There's plenty of youngsters don't care about it," said
Walker. "Here, here's Scud East&mdash;you'll be tossed,
won't you, young un?" Scud was East's nickname, or
"black," as we called it, gained by his fleetness of foot.</p>

<p>"Yes," said East, "if you like, only mind my foot."</p>

<p>"And here's another who didn't hide. Hullo! new boy;
what's your name, sir?"</p>

<p>"Brown."</p>

<p>"Well, Whitey Brown, you don't mind being tossed?"</p>

<p>"No," said Tom, setting his teeth.</p>

<p>"Come along, then, boys," sung out Walker, and away
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
they all went, carrying along Tom and East, to the intense
relief of four or five other small boys, who crept out from
under the beds and behind them.</p>

<p>"What a trump Scud is!" said one. "They won't come
back here now."</p>

<p>"And that new boy, too; he must be a good plucky one."</p>

<p>"Ah, wait until he has been tossed on to the floor; see
how he'll like it then!"</p>

<p>Meantime the procession went down the passage to No.
7, the largest room, and the scene of the tossing, in the
middle of which was a great open space. Here they joined
other parties of the bigger boys, each with a captive or
two, some willing to be tossed, some sullen, and some
frightened to death. At Walker's suggestion, all who
were afraid were let off, in honor of Pater Brooke's speech.</p>

<p>Then a dozen big boys seized hold of a blanket, dragged
from one of the beds. "In with Scud, quick! there's no
time to lose." East was chucked into the blanket. "Once,
twice, thrice, and away!" Up he went like a shuttle-cock,
but not quite up to the ceiling.</p>

<p>"Now, boys, with a will!" cried Walker. "Once, twice,
thrice, and away!" This time he went clear up, and kept
himself from touching the ceiling with his hands; and so
again a third time, when he was turned out, and up went
another boy. And then came Tom's turn. He lay quite
still, by East's advice, and didn't dislike the "once, twice,
thrice," but the "away" wasn't so pleasant. They were in
good wind now, and sent him slap up to the ceiling the
first time, against which his knees came rather sharply.
But the moment's pause before descending was the rub,
the feeling of utter helplessness, and of leaving his whole
inside behind him sticking to the ceiling. Tom was very
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
near shouting to be set down, when he found himself back
in the blanket, but thought of East, and didn't; and so
took his three tosses without a kick or a cry, and was
called a young trump for his pains.</p>

<h4>A BULLY'S REFINEMENTS.</h4>

<p>He and East, having earned it, stood now looking on.
No catastrophe happened, as all the captives were cool
hands, and didn't struggle. This didn't suit Flashman.
What your real bully likes in tossing, is when the boys
kick and struggle, or hold on to one side of the blanket,
and so get pitched bodily on to the floor; it's no fun to
him when no one is hurt or frightened.</p>

<p>"Let's toss two of them together, Walker," suggested
he. "What a cursed bully you are, Flashey!" rejoined
the other. "Up with another one."</p>

<p>And so after all, the two boys were not tossed together.
The peculiar hardship of which tossing, is that it's too much
for human nature to lie still then and share troubles; and
so the wretched pair of small boys struggle in the air
which shall fall atop in the descent, to the no small risk
of both falling out of the blanket, and the huge delight of
brutes like Flashman.</p>

<p>But now there's a cry that the pr&aelig;postor of the room
is coming; so the tossing stops, and all scatter to their
different rooms, and Tom is left to turn in with the first
day's experience of a public school to meditate upon.</p>

<h3>SETTLING TO THE COLLAR.</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class="poem"><p>
"Says Giles, 'Tis mortal hard to go;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But if so be's I must.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As goes hisself the fust."&mdash;<i>Ballad.</i></span><br />
</p></div>
</div>

<p>Everybody, I suppose, knows the dreamy, delicious
state in which one lies, half asleep, half awake, while
consciousness begins to return, after a sound night's rest
in a new place which we are glad to be in, following upon
a day of unwonted excitement and exertion. There are
few pleasanter pieces of life. The worst of it is that they
last such a short time; for, nurse them as you will, by
lying perfectly passive in mind and body, you can't make
more than five minutes or so of them. After which time
the stupid, obtrusive, wakeful entity<a name="FNanchor_1_388" id="FNanchor_1_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_388" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> which we call "I,"
as impatient as he is stiff-necked, spite of our teeth will
force himself back again, and take possession of us down
to our very toes.</p>

<h4>WAKING UP; MOVEMENTS OF BOGLE.</h4>

<p>It was in this state that Master Tom lay at half-past
seven on the morning following the day of his arrival, and
from his clean little white bed watched the movements of
Bogle (the generic name<a name="FNanchor_2_389" id="FNanchor_2_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_389" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> by which the successive shoeblacks
of the School-house were known), as he marched
round from bed to bed, collecting the dirty shoes and
boots, and depositing clean ones in their places.<a name="FNanchor_3_390" id="FNanchor_3_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_390" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>
<p>There he lay, half doubtful as to where exactly in the
universe he was, but conscious that he had made a step in
life which he had been anxious to make. It was only just
light as he looked lazily out of the wide windows, and saw
the tops of the great elms, and the rooks circling about,
and cawing remonstrances to the lazy ones of their commonwealth,
before starting in a body for the neighboring
plowed fields. The noise of the room door closing behind
Bogle, as he made his exit with the shoe-basket under his
arm, roused him thoroughly, and he sat up in bed and
looked round the room. What in the world could be the
matter with his shoulders and loins? He felt as if he had
been severely beaten all down his back, the natural results
of his performance at his first match. He drew up his
knees and rested his chin on them, and went over all the
events of yesterday, rejoicing in his new life, what he had
seen of it, and all that was to come.</p>

<p>Presently one or two of the other boys roused themselves,
and began to sit up and talk to one another in low
tones. Then East, after a roll or two, came to an anchor,
also, and, nodding to Tom, began examining his ankle.</p>

<p>"What a pull,"<a name="FNanchor_4_391" id="FNanchor_4_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_391" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> said he, "that it's lie-in-bed morning,
for I shall be as lame as a tree, I think."</p>

<p>It was Sunday morning, and Sunday lectures had not
yet been established; so that nothing but breakfast intervened
between bed and eleven o'clock chapel,&mdash;a gap by
no means easy to fill up; in fact, though received with
the correct amount of grumbling, the first lecture instituted
by the Doctor shortly afterward was a great boon to
the school. It was lie-in-bed, and no one was in a hurry
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
to get up, especially in rooms where the sixth-form boy
was a good-tempered fellow, as was the case in Tom's room,
and allowed the small boys to talk and laugh, and do
pretty much what they pleased, so long as they didn't disturb
him. His bed was a bigger one than the rest, standing
in the corner by the fire-place, with a washing-stand
and large basin by the side, where he lay in state, with
his white curtains tucked in so as to form a retiring place;
an awful subject of contemplation to Tom, who slept
nearly opposite, and watched the great man rouse himself
and take a book from under his pillow, and begin reading,
leaning his head on his hand, and turning his back to the
room. Soon, however, a noise of striving urchins arose,
and muttered encouragements from the neighboring boys,
of&mdash;"Go it, Tadpole!" "Now, young Green!" "Haul
away his blanket!" "Slipper him on the hands!" Young
Green and little Hall, commonly called Tadpole, from his
great black head and thin legs, slept side by side far away
by the door, and were forever playing one another tricks,
which usually ended, as on this morning, in open and
violent collision: and now, unmindful of all order and
authority, there they were each hauling away at the other's
bed-clothes with one hand, and with the other, armed with
a slipper, belaboring whatever portion of the body of his
adversary came within reach.</p>

<h4>GETTING UP.</h4>

<p>"Hold that noise, up in the corner!" called out the
pr&aelig;postor, sitting up and looking round his curtains; and
the Tadpole and young Green sank down into their disordered
beds, and then, looking at his watch, added:
"Hullo, past eight!&mdash;whose turn for hot water?"</p>

<p>(Where the pr&aelig;postor was particular in his ablutions,
the fags in his room had to descend in turn to the kitchen,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
and beg or steal hot water for him; and often the custom
extended further, and two boys went down every morning
to get a supply for the whole room.)</p>

<p>"East's and Tadpole's," answered the senior fag, who
kept the rota.<a name="FNanchor_5_392" id="FNanchor_5_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_392" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>"I can't go," said East; "I'm dead lame."</p>

<p>"Well, be quick, some of you, that's all," said the great
man, as he turned out of bed, and putting on his slippers,
went out into the great passage which runs the whole
length of the bedrooms, to get his Sunday habiliments out
of his portmanteau.</p>

<p>"Let me go for you," said Tom to East. "I should
like it."</p>

<p>"Well, thank'ee, that's a good fellow. Just pull on
your trousers, and take your jug<a name="FNanchor_6_393" id="FNanchor_6_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_393" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and mine. Tadpole will
show you the way."</p>

<p>And so Tom and the Tadpole, in night-shirts and
trousers, started off down-stairs, and through "Thos's
hole," as the little buttery, where candles and beer and
bread and cheese were served out at night, was called;
across the School-house court, down a long passage, and
into the kitchen; where, after some parley with the stalwart,
handsome cook, who declared that she had filled a
dozen jugs already, they got their hot water, and returned
with all speed and great caution. As it was, they narrowly
escaped capture by some privateers<a name="FNanchor_7_394" id="FNanchor_7_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_394" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> from the fifth-form
rooms, who were on the look-out for the hot-water convoys,
and pursued them up to the very door of their room,
making them spill half their load in the passage. "Better
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
than going down again, though," Tadpole remarked, "as
we should have had to do, if those beggars had caught us."</p>

<h4>THE "CLOSE" BEFORE CHAPEL.</h4>

<p>By the time that the calling-over bell rang, Tom and
his new comrades were all down, dressed in their best
clothes, and he had the satisfaction of answering "here"
to his name for the first time, the pr&aelig;postor of the week
having put it in at the bottom of his list. And then came
breakfast, and a saunter about the close and town with
East, whose lameness only became severe when any fagging
had to be done. And so they whiled away the time
until morning chapel.</p>

<p>It was a fine November morning, and the close soon became
alive with boys of all ages, who sauntered about on
the grass, or walked round the gravel-walk, in parties of
two or three. East, still doing the cicerone, pointed out
all the remarkable characters to Tom as they passed:
Osbert, who could throw a cricket ball from the little side
ground over the rook-trees to the Doctor's wall; Gray, who
had got the Balliol scholarship, and, what East evidently
thought of much more importance, a half-holiday for the
school by his success; Thorne, who had run ten miles in
two minutes over the hour; Black, who had held his own
against the cock of the town in the last row with the
louts; and many more heroes, who then and there walked
about and were worshipped, all trace of whom has long
since vanished from the scene of their fame; and the
fourth-form boy who reads their names rudely cut out on
old hall tables, or painted upon the big side-cupboard (if
hall tables and big side-cupboards still exist), wonders
what manner of boys they were. It will be the same with
you who wonder, my sons, whatever your prowess may be,
in cricket, or scholarship, or foot-ball. Two or three
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
years, more or less, and then the steadily advancing,
blessed wave will pass over your names as it has passed
over ours. Nevertheless, play your games and do your
work manfully&mdash;see only that that be done, and let the
remembrance of it take care of itself.</p>

<h4>MORNING AND AFTERNOON CHAPEL.</h4>

<p>The chapel-bell began to ring at a quarter to eleven,
and Tom got in early, took his place in the lowest row,
and watched all the other boys come in and take their
places, filling row after row; and tried to construe<a name="FNanchor_8_395" id="FNanchor_8_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_395" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> the
Greek text which was inscribed over the door with the
slightest possible success, and wondering which of the
masters, who walked down the chapel and took their seats
in the exalted boxes at the end, would be his lord. And
then came the closing of the doors, and the Doctor, in his
robes, and the service, which, however, didn't impress
him much, for his feeling of wonder and curiosity was too
strong. And the boy on one side of him was scratching
his name on the oak paneling in front, and he couldn't
help watching to see what the name was, and whether it
was well scratched; and the boy on the other side went to
sleep and kept falling against him; and on the whole,
though many boys even in that part of the School, were
serious and attentive, the general atmosphere was by no
means devotional; and when he got out into the close
again, he didn't feel at all comfortable, or as if he had
been to church.</p>

<p>But at afternoon chapel it was quite another thing.
He had spent the time after dinner in writing home to
his mother, and so was in a better frame of mind: and
his first curiosity was over, and he could attend more to
the service. As the hymn after the prayers was being
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
sung, and the chapel was getting a little dark, he was
beginning to feel that he had been really worshipping. And
then came that great event in his, as in every Rugby boy's
life of that day,&mdash;the first sermon from the Doctor.</p>

<h4>THE SERMON.</h4>

<p>More worthy pens than mine have described that scene&mdash;the
oak pulpit standing out by itself above the School
seats; the tall, gallant form, the kindling eye, the voice,
now soft as the low notes of a flute, now clear and stirring
as the call of the light infantry bugle, of him who stood
there Sunday after Sunday, witnessing and pleading for his
Lord, the King of righteousness and love and glory, with
whose spirit he was filled, and in whose power he spoke;
the long lines of young faces, rising tier above tier down
the whole length of the chapel, from the little boy's who
had just left his mother to the young man's who was
going out next week into the great world rejoicing in his
strength. It was a great and solemn sight, and never
more so than at this time of the year, when the only lights
in the chapel were in the pulpit and at the seats of the
pr&aelig;postors of the week, and the soft twilight stole over
the rest of the chapel, deepening into darkness in the
high gallery behind the organ.</p>

<p>But what was it, after all, which seized and held these
three hundred boys, dragging them out of themselves,
willing or unwilling, for twenty minutes, on Sunday afternoons?
True, there always were boys scattered up and
down the School, who in heart and head were worthy to
hear and able to carry away the deepest and wisest words
spoken. But these were a minority always, generally a
very small one, often so small a one as to be countable on
the fingers of your hand. What was it that moved and
held us, the rest of the three hundred reckless, childish
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
boys, who feared the Doctor with our hearts, and very
little besides in heaven or earth: who thought more of our
sets<a name="FNanchor_9_396" id="FNanchor_9_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_396" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> in the School than of the Church of Christ, and put
the traditions of Rugby and the public opinion of boys in
our daily life above the laws of God? We couldn't enter
into half that we heard; we hadn't the knowledge of our
own hearts or the knowledge of one another; and little
enough of the faith, hope, and love needed to that end.
But we listened, as all boys in their better moods will
listen (ay, and men, too, for the matter of that), to a man
whom we felt to be, with all his heart and soul and
strength, striving against whatever was mean and unmanly
and unrighteous in our little world. It was not
the cold clear voice of one giving advice and warning from
serene heights to those who were struggling and sinning
below, but the warm living voice of one who was fighting
for us and by our sides, and calling on us to help him and
ourselves and one another. And so, wearily and little by
little, but surely and steadily on the whole, was brought
home to the young boy, for the first time, the meaning of
his life: that it was no fool's or sluggard's paradise into
which he had wandered by chance, but a battle-field ordained
from of old, where there are no spectators, but the
youngest must take his side, and the stakes are life and
death. And he who roused this consciousness in them
showed them at the same time, by every word he spoke in
the pulpit, and by his whole daily life, how that battle was
to be fought; and stood there before them their fellow-soldier
and the captain of their band. The true sort of
captain, too, for a boy's army, one who had no misgivings
and gave no uncertain word of command, and, let who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
would yield or make truce, would fight the fight out (so
every boy felt) to the last gasp and the last drop of blood.
Other sides of his character might take hold of and influence
boys here and there, but it was this thoroughness
and undaunted courage which more than anything else
won his way to the hearts of the great mass of those on
whom he left his mark, and made them believe first in him,
and then in his Master.</p>

<h4>THE DOCTOR'S FIRST HOLD.</h4>

<p>It was this quality, above all others, which moved such
boys as our hero, who had nothing whatever remarkable
about him except excess of boyishness; by which I mean
animal life in its fullest measure, good-nature and honest
impulses, hatred of injustice and meanness, and thoughtlessness
enough to sink a three-decker.<a name="FNanchor_10_397" id="FNanchor_10_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_397" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> And so, during
the next two years, in which it was more than doubtful
whether he would get good or evil from the school, and
before any steady purpose or principle grew up in him,
whatever his week's sins or shortcomings might have been,
he hardly ever left the chapel on Sunday evenings without
a serious resolve to stand by and follow the Doctor, and a
feeling that it was only cowardice (the incarnation<a name="FNanchor_11_398" id="FNanchor_11_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_398" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> of all
other sins in such a boy's mind) which hindered him from
doing so with all his heart.</p>

<p>The next day Tom was duly placed in the third form,
and began his lessons in a corner of the Big School.<a name="FNanchor_12_399" id="FNanchor_12_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_399" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> He
found the work very easy, as he had been well grounded
and knew his grammar by heart; and, as he had no intimate
companion to make him idle (East and his other
School-house friends being in the lower fourth, the form
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
above him), soon gained golden opinions from his master,
who said he was placed too low, and should be put out at
the end of the half-year. So all went well with him in
school, and he wrote the most flourishing letters home to
his mother, full of his own success, and the unspeakable
delights of a public school.</p>

<p>In the house too all went well. The end of the half-year
was drawing near, which kept everybody in a good
humor, and the house was ruled well and strongly by
Warner and Brooke. True, the general system was rough
and hard, and there was bullying in nooks and corners,
bad signs for the future; but it never got further, or dared
show itself openly, stalking about the passages and hall
and bedrooms, and making the life of the small boys a
continual fear.</p>

<h4>HOUSE-FAGGING.</h4>

<p>Tom, as a new boy, was of right excused fagging for
the first month, but in his enthusiasm for his new life
this privilege hardly pleased him; and East and others of
his young friends discovering this, kindly allowed him to
indulge his fancy, and take their turns at night-fagging
and cleaning studies. These were the principal duties of
the fags in the house. From supper until nine o'clock,
three fags taken in order stood in the passages, and answered
any pr&aelig;postor who called fag, racing to the door,
the last comer having to do the work. This consisted
generally of going to the buttery for beer and bread and
cheese (for the great men did not sup with the rest, but
had each his own allowance, in his study or the fifth-form
room), cleaning candlesticks and putting in new candles,
toasting cheese, and carrying messages about the house;
and Tom, in the first blush of his hero-worship, felt it a
high privilege to receive orders from, and be the bearer of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
the supper of old Brooke. And besides this night-work
each pr&aelig;postor had three or four fags specially allotted to
him, of whom he was supposed to be the guide, philosopher,
and friend, and who in return for these good offices
had to clean out his study every morning by turns, directly
after first lesson and before he returned from breakfast.
And the pleasure of seeing the great men's studies, and
looking at their pictures, and peeping into their books,
made Tom a ready substitute for any boy who was too
lazy to do his own work. And so he gained the character
of a good-natured, willing fellow, who was ready to do a
turn for any one.</p>

<p>In all the games, too, he joined with all his heart, and
soon became well versed in all the mysteries of foot-ball,
by continual practice at the School-house little-side, which
played daily.</p>

<h4>HARE AND HOUNDS.</h4>

<p>The only incident worth recording here, however, was
his first run at Hare and Hounds. On the last Tuesday but
one of the half-year, he was passing through the hall after
dinner, when he was hailed with shouts from Tadpole and
several other fags seated at one of the long tables, the
chorus of which was "Come and help us tear up scent."</p>

<p>Tom approached the table in obedience to the mysterious
summons, always ready to help, and found the party
engaged in tearing up old newspapers, copy-books, and
magazines into small pieces, with which they were filling
four large canvas bags.</p>

<p>"It's the turn of our house to find scent for big-side
Hare and Hounds," exclaimed Tadpole; "tear away, there's
no time to lose before calling-over."</p>

<p>"I think it's a great shame," said another small boy,
"to have such a hard run for the last day."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>
<p>"Which run is it?" cried Tadpole.</p>

<p>"Oh, the Barby run, I hear," answered the other;
"nine miles at least, and hard ground; no chance of getting
in at the finish, unless you're a first-rate scud."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm going to have a try," said Tadpole; "it's
the last run of the half."</p>

<p>"I should like to try, too," said Tom.</p>

<p>"Well, then leave your waistcoat behind, and listen at the
door, after calling-over, and you'll hear where the meet is."</p>

<p>After calling-over, sure enough, there were two boys at
the door calling out: "Big-side Hare and Hounds meet at
White Hall"; and Tom, having girded himself with a
leather strap, and left all superfluous clothing behind, set
off for White Hall, an old gable-ended<a name="FNanchor_13_400" id="FNanchor_13_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_400" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> house some quarter
of a mile from the town, and East, whom he had
persuaded to join, notwithstanding his prophecy that they
could never get in, as it was the hardest run of the year.</p>

<h4>THE MEET AND THE FIRST BURST.</h4>

<p>At the meet they found some forty or fifty boys, and
Tom felt sure, from having seen many of them run at foot-ball,
that he and East were more likely to get in than they.</p>

<p>After a few minutes' waiting, two well-known runners,
chosen for the hares, buckled on the four bags filled with
scent, compared their watches with those of young Brooke
and Thorne, and started off at a long, slinging trot across
the fields in the direction of Barby.</p>

<p>Then the hounds clustered round Thorne, who explained
shortly, "They're to have six minutes' law.<a name="FNanchor_14_401" id="FNanchor_14_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_401" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> We
run to the Cock,<a name="FNanchor_15_402" id="FNanchor_15_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_402" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and every one who comes in within a
quarter of an hour of the hares'll be counted, if he has
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
been round Barby Church." Then came a minute's pause
or so, and then the watches are pocketed, and the pack is
led through the gate-way into the field which the hares
had first crossed. Here they break into a trot, scattering
over the field to find the first traces of the scent which
the hares throw out as they go along. The old hounds
make straight for the likely points, and in a minute a cry
of "Forward" comes from one of them, and the whole
pack quickening their pace make for the spot, while the
boy who hit the scent first, and the two or three nearest
to him, are over the first fence, and making play along
the hedge-row in the long grass-field beyond. The rest
of the pack rush at the gap already made, and scramble
through, jostling one another. "Forward" again, before
they are half through; the pace quickens into a sharp
run, the tail hounds all straining to get up to the lucky
leaders. They are gallant hares, and the scent lies thick
right across another meadow and into a plowed field,
where the pace begins to tell; then over a good wattle<a name="FNanchor_16_403" id="FNanchor_16_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_403" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
with a ditch on the other side, and down a large pasture
studded with old thorns, which slopes down to the first
brook; the great Leicestershire<a name="FNanchor_17_404" id="FNanchor_17_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_404" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> sheep charge away across
the field as the pack comes racing down the slope. The
brook is a small one, and the scent lies right ahead up the
opposite slope, and as thick as ever; not a turn or a check
to favor the tail hounds, who strain on, now trailing in
a long line, many a youngster beginning to drag his legs
heavily, and feel his heart beat like a hammer, and the
bad plucked ones thinking that after all it isn't worth
while to keep it up.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>
<p>Tom, East, and the Tadpole had a good start, and are
well up for such young hands, and, after rising the slope
and crossing the next field, find themselves up with the
leading hounds, who have overrun the scent, and are trying
back; they have come a mile and a half in about
eleven minutes, a pace which shows that it is the last day.
About twenty-five of the original starters only show here,
the rest having already given in; the leaders are busy
making casts<a name="FNanchor_18_405" id="FNanchor_18_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_405" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> into the fields on the left and right, and
the others get their second winds.</p>

<p>Then comes the cry of "Forward" again, from young
Brooke, from the extreme left, and the pack settle down
to work again steadily and doggedly, the whole keeping
pretty well together. The scent, though still good, is not
so thick; there is no need of that, for in this part of the
run every one knows the line which must be taken, and
so there are no casts to be made, but good downright
running and fencing to be done. All who are now up
mean coming in, and they come to the foot of Barby Hill
without losing more than two or three more of the pack.
This last straight two miles and a half is always a vantage-ground<a name="FNanchor_19_406" id="FNanchor_19_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_406" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
for the hounds, and the hares know it well;
they are generally viewed on the side of Barby Hill, and
all eyes are on the look-out for them to-day. But not
a sign of them appears, so now will be the hard work for
the hounds, and there is nothing for it but to cast about
for the scent, for it is now the hares' turn, and they may
baffle the pack dreadfully in the next two miles.</p>

<p>Ill fares it now with our youngsters that they are
School-house boys, and so follow young Brooke, for he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
takes the wide casts round to the left, conscious of his
own powers, and loving the hard work. For if you
would consider for a moment, you small boys, you would
remember that the Cock, where the run ends, lies far out
to the right, on the Dunchurch road, so that every cast
you take to the left is so much extra work. And at this
stage of the run, when the evening is closing in already,
no one remarks whether you run a little cunning or not,
so you should stick to those crafty hounds who keep
edging away to the right, and not follow a prodigal like
young Brooke, whose legs are twice as long as yours and
of cast-iron, wholly indifferent to one or two miles, more
or less. However, they struggle after him, panting and
plunging along, Tom and East pretty close, and Tadpole,
whose big head begins to pull him down, some thirty
yards behind.</p>

<h4>THE FIRST CHECK.</h4>

<p>Now comes a brook, with stiff clay banks, from which
they can hardly drag their legs, and they hear faint cries
for help from the wretched Tadpole, who has fairly stuck
fast. But they have too little run left in themselves to
pull up for their own brothers. Three fields more, and
another check, and then "forward," called away to the
extreme right.</p>

<p>The two boys' souls die within them; they can never do
it. Young Brooke thinks so, too, and says, kindly: "You'll
cross a lane after next field, keep down it, and you'll hit
the Dunchurch road below the Cock," and then, steams
away for the run in, in which he's sure to be first, as if he
were just starting. They struggle on across the next field,
the "forwards" getting fainter and fainter, and then ceasing.
The whole hunt is out of earshot, and all hope of
coming in is over.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>
<h4>NO GO.</h4>

<p>"Hang it all!" broke out East, as soon as he had got
wind enough, pulling off his hat and mopping at his face,
all spattered with dirt, and lined with sweat, from which
went up a thick steam into the still, cold air. "I told you
how it would be. What a thick<a name="FNanchor_20_407" id="FNanchor_20_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_407" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> I was to come! Here
we are dead beat, and yet I know we're close to the run
in, if we knew the country."</p>

<p>"Well," said Tom, mopping away, and gulping down
his disappointment, "it can't be helped. We did our best,
anyhow. Hadn't we better find this lane, and go down it
as young Brooke told us?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so&mdash;nothing else for it," grunted East. "If
ever I go out last day again," growl&mdash;growl&mdash;growl.</p>

<p>So they tried back slowly and sorrowfully, and found
the lane, and went limping down it, plashing in the cold,
puddly ruts, and beginning to feel how the run had taken
it out of them. The evening closed in fast, and clouded
over, dark, cold, and dreary.</p>

<h4>CONSEQUENCES.</h4>

<p>"I say, it must be locking-up, I should think," remarked
East, breaking the silence; "it's so dark."</p>

<p>"What if we're late?" said Tom.</p>

<p>"No tea, and sent up to the Doctor," answered East.</p>

<p>The thought didn't add to their cheerfulness. Presently
a faint halloo was heard from an adjoining field. They
answered it, and stopped, hoping for some competent rustic
to guide them, when over a gate some twenty yards
ahead crawled the wretched Tadpole, in a state of collapse;
he had lost a shoe in the brook, and had been
groping in it up to his elbows in the stiff, wet clay, and a
more miserable creature in the shape of a boy seldom has
been seen.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>
<p>The sight of him, notwithstanding, cheered them, for he
was some degrees more wretched than they. They also
cheered him, as he was no longer under the dread of passing
his night alone in the fields. And so in better heart
the three plashed painfully down the never-ending lane.
At last it widened, just as utter darkness set in, and they
came out on a turnpike road, and there paused bewildered,
for they had lost all bearings, and knew not whether to
turn to the right or left.</p>

<p>Luckily for them they had not to decide, for lumbering
along the road, with one lamp lighted, and two spavined
horses in the shafts, came a heavy coach, which after a
moment's suspense, they recognized as the Oxford coach,
the redoubtable Pig and Whistle.</p>

<p>It lumbered slowly up, and the boys mustering their
last run, caught it as it passed, and began clambering up
behind, in which exploit East missed his footing, and fell
flat on his nose along the road. Then the others hailed
the old scarecrow of a coachman, who pulled up and
agreed to take them in for a shilling; so there they sat on
the back seat, drubbing with their heels, and their teeth
chattering with cold, and jogged into Rugby some forty
minutes after locking-up.</p>

<h4>THEIR RECEPTION.</h4>

<p>Five minutes afterward, three small, limping, shivering
figures steal along through the Doctor's garden, and into
the house by the servants' entrance (all the other gates
have been closed long since), where the first thing they
light upon in the passage is old Thomas, ambling along,
candle in one hand and keys in the other.</p>

<p>He stops and examines their condition with a grim
smile. "Ah! East, Hall, and Brown, late for locking-up.
Must go up to the Doctor's study at once."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>
<p>"Well, but Thomas, mayn't we go and wash first?
You can put down the time, you know."</p>

<p>"Doctor's study d'rectly you come in&mdash;that's the
orders," replied old Thomas, motioning toward the stairs
at the end of the passage which led up into the Doctor's
house; and the boys turned ruefully down it, not cheered
by the old verger's muttered remark, "What a pickle they
boys be in!" Thomas referred to their faces and habiliments,
but they construed it as indicating the Doctor's
state of mind. Upon the short flight of stairs they paused
to hold counsel.</p>

<p>"Who'll go in first?" inquires Tadpole.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you're the senior," answered East.</p>

<p>"Catch me&mdash;look at the state I'm in," rejoined Hall,
showing the arms of his jacket. "I must get behind you
two."</p>

<p>"Well, but look at me," said East indicating the mass
of clay behind which he was standing; "I'm worse than
you, two to one; you might grow cabbages on my trousers."</p>

<p>"That's all down below, and you can keep your legs
behind the sofa," said Hall.</p>

<p>"Here, Brown, you're the show figure&mdash;you must lead."</p>

<p>"But my face is all muddy," argued Tom.</p>

<p>"Oh, we're all in one boat, for that matter; but, come
on, we're only making it worse, dawdling here."</p>

<p>"Well, just give us a brush then," said Tom: and they
began trying to rub off the superfluous dirt from each
other's jackets, but it was not dry enough, and the rubbing
made them worse; so in despair they pushed through the
swing door at the head of the stairs, and found themselves
in the Doctor's hall.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>
<p>"That's the library door," said East, in a whisper,
pushing Tom forward. The sound of merry voices and
laughter came from within, and his first hesitating knock
was unanswered. But at the second, the Doctor's voice
said, "Come in," and Tom turned the handle, and he,
with the others behind him, sidled into the room.</p>

<p>The Doctor looked up from his task; he was working
away with a great chisel at the bottom of a boy's sailing-boat,
the lines of which he was no doubt fashioning on the
model of one of Nicias's galleys.<a name="FNanchor_21_408" id="FNanchor_21_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_408" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Round him stood three
or four children; the candles burnt brightly on a large
table at the further end, covered with books and papers,
and a great fire threw a ruddy glow over the rest of the
room. All looked so kindly and homely,<a name="FNanchor_22_409" id="FNanchor_22_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_409" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and comfortable,
that the boys took heart in a moment, and Tom advanced,
from behind the shelter of the great sofa. The Doctor
nodded to the children, who went out, casting curious and
amused glances at the three young scarecrows.</p>

<h4>THEIR EXPLANATION.</h4>

<p>"Well, my little fellows," began the Doctor, drawing
himself up with his back to the fire, the chisel in one
hand and his coat-tails in the other; and his eyes twinkling
as he looked them over; "what makes you so late?"</p>

<p>"Please, sir, we've been out big-side Hare and Hounds,
and lost our way."</p>

<p>"Hah! you couldn't keep up, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said East, stepping out, and not liking
that the Doctor should think lightly of his running powers,
"we got round Barby all right, but then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, what a state you're in, my boy!" interrupted
the Doctor, as the pitiful condition of East's garments was
fully revealed to him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>
<p>"That's the fall I got, sir, in the road," said East, looking
down at himself; "the Old Pig came by&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The what?" said the Doctor.</p>

<p>"Oxford coach, sir," explained Hall.</p>

<p>"Hah! yes, the Regulator," said the Doctor.</p>

<p>"And I tumbled on my face, trying to get up behind,"
went on East.</p>

<p>"You're not hurt, I hope?" said the Doctor.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, now, run up-stairs, all three of you, and get
clean things on, and then tell the housekeeper to give you
some tea. You're too young to try such long runs. Let
Warner know I've seen you. Good-night."</p>

<p>"Good-night, sir." And away scuttled the three boys
in high glee.</p>

<p>"What a brick, not to give us even twenty lines to
learn!" said the Tadpole, as they reached their bedroom;
and in half an hour afterward they were sitting by the fire
in the housekeeper's room at a sumptuous tea, with cold
meat, "twice as good a grub as we should have got in the
hall," as the Tadpole remarked with a grin, his mouth full
of buttered toast. All their grievances were forgotten,
and they were resolving to go out the first big-side next
half, and thinking Hare and Hounds the most delightful of
games.</p>

<h4>LAST DAYS.</h4>

<p>A day or two afterward the great passage outside the
bedrooms was cleared of the boxes and portmanteaus,
which went down to be packed by the matron, and great
games of chariot-racing, and cock-fighting, and bolstering<a name="FNanchor_23_410" id="FNanchor_23_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_410" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
went on in the vacant space, the sure sign of a closing
half-year.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>
<p>Then came the making up of parties for the journey
home, and Tom joined a party who were to hire a coach,
and post with four horses to Oxford.</p>

<p>Then the last Saturday on which the Doctor came round
to each form to give out the prizes, and hear the masters'
last report of how they and their charges had been conducting
themselves; and Tom, to his huge delight, was
praised, and got his remove into the lower fourth, in
which all his School-house friends were.</p>

<p>On the next Tuesday morning, at four o'clock, hot coffee
was going on in the housekeeper's and matron's rooms:
boys wrapped in great-coats and mufflers were swallowing
hasty mouthfuls, rushing about, tumbling over luggage,
and asking questions all at once of the matron; outside
the School-gates were drawn up several chaises and the
four-horse coach which Tom's party had chartered, the
post-boys<a name="FNanchor_24_411" id="FNanchor_24_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_411" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> in their best jackets and breeches, and a cornopean<a name="FNanchor_25_412" id="FNanchor_25_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_412" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
player, hired for the occasion, blowing away, "A
southerly wind and a cloudy day," waking all peaceful inhabitants
half-way down the High Street.</p>

<p>Every minute the bustle and hubbub increased; porters
staggered about with boxes and bags, the cornopean played
louder. Old Thomas sat in his den with a great yellow
bag by his side, out of which he was paying journey money
to each boy, comparing by the light of a solitary dip the
dirty crabbed little list in his own handwriting, with the
Doctor's list, and the amount of his cash; his head was on
one side, his mouth screwed up, and his spectacles dim
from early toil. He had prudently locked the door, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
carried on his operations through the window, or he would
have been driven wild and lost all his money.</p>

<p>"Thomas, do be quick; we shall never catch the Highflyer<a name="FNanchor_26_413" id="FNanchor_26_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_413" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
at Dunchurch."</p>

<p>"That's your money, all right, Green."</p>

<p>"Hullo, Thomas, the Doctor said I was to have two-pound-ten;
you've only given me two pound." I fear that
Master Green is not confining himself strictly to truth.
Thomas turns his head more on one side than ever, and
spells away at the dirty list. Green is forced away from
the window.</p>

<p>"Here, Thomas, never mind him, mine's thirty shillings."
"And mine too," "And mine," shouted others.</p>

<p>One way or another, the party to which Tom belonged all
got packed and paid, and sallied out to the gates, the cornopean
playing frantically, "Drops of Brandy," in allusion,
probably, to the slight potations in which the musicians
and post-boys had been already indulging. All
luggage was carefully stowed away inside the coach and in
the front and hind boots, so that not a hat-box was visible
outside. Five or six small boys, with pea-shooters, and
the cornopean player, got up behind; in front the big
boys, mostly smoking, not for pleasure, but because they
are now gentlemen at large<a name="FNanchor_27_414" id="FNanchor_27_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_414" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>&mdash;and this is the most correct
public method of notifying the fact.</p>

<h4>OFF.</h4>

<p>"Robinson's coach will be down the road in a minute;
it has gone up to Bird's to pick up&mdash;we'll wait till they're
close, and make a race of it," says the leader. "Now,
boys, half a sovereign apiece if you beat 'em into Dunchurch
by one hundred yards."</p>

<p>"All right, sir," shouted the grinning post-boys. Down
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
comes Robinson's coach in a minute or two with
a rival cornopean, and away go the two vehicles, horses
galloping, boys cheering, horns playing loud. There is a
special Providence over schoolboys as well as sailors, or
they must have upset twenty times in the first five miles,
sometimes actually abreast of one another, and the boys on
the roofs exchanging volleys of peas, now nearly running
over a post-chaise which had started before them, now half-way
up a bank, now with a wheel-and-a-half over a yawning
ditch; and all this in a dark morning, with nothing
but their own lamps to guide them. However, it is all
over at last, and they have run over nothing but an old
pig in Southam Street; the last peas are distributed in the
Corn Market<a name="FNanchor_28_415" id="FNanchor_28_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_415" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> at Oxford, where they arrive between eleven
and twelve, and sit down to a sumptuous breakfast at the
Angel, which they are made to pay for accordingly. Here
the party breaks up, all going now different ways: and
Tom orders out a chaise and pair as grand as a lord,
though he has scarcely five shillings left in his pocket, and
more than twenty miles to get home.</p>

<h4>DULCE DOMUM.</h4>

<p>"Where to, sir?"</p>

<p>"Red Lion, Farringdon," says Tom, giving ostler a shilling.</p>

<p>"All right, sir. Red Lion, Jem," to the post-boy, and
Tom rattles away toward home. At Farringdon, being
known to the innkeeper, he gets that worthy to pay for
the Oxford horses, and forward him in another chaise at
once; and so the gorgeous young gentleman arrives at the
paternal mansion, and Squire Brown looks rather blue at
having to pay two pounds ten shillings for the posting expenses
from Oxford. But the boy's intense joy at getting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
home, and the wonderful health he is in, and the good
character he brings, and the brave stories he tells of
Rugby, its doings and delights, soon mollify the Squire,
and three happier people didn't sit down to dinner that
day in England (it is the boy's first dinner at six o'clock
at home, great promotion already), than the Squire and
his wife and Tom Brown, at the end of his first half-year
at Rugby.</p>

<h4>THE LOWER FOURTH.</h4>

<p>The lower-fourth form, in which Tom found himself
at the beginning of the next half-year, was the largest
form in the lower school, and numbered upward of forty
boys. Young gentlemen of all ages, from nine to fifteen,
were to be found there, who expended such part of their
energies as was devoted to Latin and Greek, upon a book
of Livy, the Bucolics<a name="FNanchor_1_416" id="FNanchor_1_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_416" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> of Virgil, and the Hecuba<a name="FNanchor_2_417" id="FNanchor_2_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_417" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> of Euripides,
which were ground out in small daily portions.
The driving of this unlucky lower fourth must have been
grievous work to the unfortunate master, for it was the
most unhappily constituted of any in the School. Here
stuck the great stupid boys, who for the life of them
could never master the accidence;<a name="FNanchor_3_418" id="FNanchor_3_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_418" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> the objects alternately
of mirth and terror to the youngsters, who were daily
taking them up, and laughing at them in lesson, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
getting kicked by them for so doing in play-hours. There
were no less than three unhappy fellows in tail coats, with
incipient down on their chins, whom the Doctor and the
master of the form were always endeavoring to hoist into
the upper school, but whose parsing and construing resisted
the most well-meant shoves. Then came the mass
of the form, boys of eleven and twelve, the most mischievous
and reckless age of British youth, of whom East and
Tom Brown were fair specimens. As full of tricks as
monkeys, and of excuses as Irish women, making fun of
their master, one another, and their lessons, Argus<a name="FNanchor_4_419" id="FNanchor_4_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_419" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> himself
would have been puzzled to keep an eye on them;
and as for making them steady or serious for half an hour
together, it was simply hopeless. The remainder of the
form consisted of young prodigies of nine or ten, who
were going up the school at the rate of a form a half-year,
all boys' hands and wits being against them in their progress.
It would have been one man's work to see that the
precocious youngsters had fair play; and as the master
had a good deal besides to do, they hadn't, and were forever
being shoved down three or four places, their verses
stolen, their books inked, their jackets whitened, and their
lives otherwise made a burden to them.</p>

<p>The lower fourth, and all the forms below it, were
heard in the Great School, and were not trusted to prepare
their lessons before coming in, but were whipped into
school three-quarters of an hour before the lessons began
by their respective masters, and there, scattered about on
the benches, with dictionary and grammar, hammered
out their twenty lines of Virgil and Euripides in the midst
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
of Babel.<a name="FNanchor_5_420" id="FNanchor_5_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_420" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The masters of the lower school walked up
and down the Great School together during this three-quarters
of an hour, or sat in their desks reading or looking
over copies, and keeping such order as was possible.
But the lower fourth was just now an overgrown form, too
large for any one man to attend to properly, and consequently
the elysium<a name="FNanchor_6_421" id="FNanchor_6_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_421" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> or ideal form of the young scapegraces
who formed the staple<a name="FNanchor_7_422" id="FNanchor_7_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_422" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> of it.</p>

<p>Tom, as has been said, had come up from the third
with a good character, but the temptations of the lower
fourth soon proved too strong for him, and he rapidly
fell away, and became as unmanageable as the rest. For
some weeks, indeed, he succeeded in maintaining the appearance
of steadiness, and was looked upon favorably by
his new master, whose eyes were first opened by the following
little incident.</p>

<p>Besides the desk which the master himself occupied,
there was another large unoccupied desk in the corner of
the Great School, which was untenanted. To rush and
seize upon this desk, which was ascended by three steps,
and held four boys, was the great object of ambition of
the lower-fourthers; and the contentions for the occupation
of it bred such disorder, that at last the master forbade
its use altogether. This of course was a challenge
to the more adventurous spirits to occupy it, and as it was
capacious enough for two boys to lie hid there completely,
it was seldom that it remained empty, notwithstanding
the veto.<a name="FNanchor_8_423" id="FNanchor_8_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_423" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Small holes were cut in the front, through
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
which the occupants watched the masters as they walked
up and down, and as lesson-time approached, one boy at a
time stole out and down the steps, as the masters' backs
were turned, and mingled with the general crowd on the
forms below. Tom and East had successfully occupied
the desk some half-dozen times, and were grown so reckless
that they were in the habit of playing small games
with fives'-balls inside, when the masters were at the other
end of the Big School. One day, as ill-luck would have it,
the game became more exciting than usual, and the ball
slipped through East's fingers, and rolled slowly down the
steps, and out into the middle of the school, just as the
masters turned in their walk, and faced round upon
the desk. The young delinquents watched their master,
through the look-out holes, marching slowly down the
school straight upon their retreat, while all the boys in the
neighborhood of course stopped their work to look on;
and not only were they ignominiously drawn out, and
caned over the hand then and there, but their characters
for steadiness were gone from that time. However, as
they only shared the fate of some three-fourths of the rest
of the form, this did not weigh heavily upon them.</p>

<h4>MONTHLY EXAMINATIONS.</h4>

<p>In fact, the only occasions on which they cared about
the matter were the monthly examinations, when the
Doctor came round to examine their form, for one long
awful hour, in the work which they had done in the preceding
month. The second monthly examination came
round soon after Tom's fall, and it was with anything but
lively anticipations that he and the other lower-fourth
boys came in to prayers on the morning of the examination
day.</p>

<p>Prayers and calling-over seemed twice as short as usual,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
and before they could get construes of a tithe<a name="FNanchor_9_424" id="FNanchor_9_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_424" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> of the hard
passages marked in the margin of their books, they were all
seated round, and the Doctor was standing in the middle,
talking in whispers to the master. Tom couldn't hear a
word which passed, and never lifted his eyes from his
book; but he knew by a kind of magnetic instinct that
the Doctor's under lip was coming out, and his eye beginning
to burn, and his gown getting gathered up more
and more tightly in his left hand. The suspense was
agonizing, and Tom knew that he was sure on such
occasions to make an example of the School-house boys.
"If he would only begin," thought Tom, "I shouldn't
mind."</p>

<p>At last the whispering ceased, and the name which was
called out was not Brown. He looked up for a moment,
but the Doctor's face was too awful; Tom wouldn't have
met his eye for all he was worth, and buried himself in
his book again.</p>

<h4>TRISTE LUPUS.</h4>

<p>The boy who was called up first was a clever,<a name="FNanchor_10_425" id="FNanchor_10_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_425" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> merry
School-house boy, one of their set; he was some connection
of the Doctor's and a great favorite, and ran in and
out of his house as he liked, and so was selected for the
first victim.</p>

<p>"Triste lupus stabulis,"<a name="FNanchor_11_426" id="FNanchor_11_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_426" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> began the luckless youngster,
and stammered through some eight or ten lines.</p>

<p>"There, that will do," said the Doctor, "now construe."</p>

<p>On common occasions, the boy could have construed
the passage well enough, probably, but now his head was
gone.</p>

<p>"Triste lupus, the sorrowful wolf," he began. A
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
shudder ran through the whole form, and the Doctor's
wrath fairly boiled over; he made three steps up to
the construer, and gave him a good box on the ear. The
blow was not a hard one, but the boy was so taken by
surprise that he started back; the form<a name="FNanchor_12_427" id="FNanchor_12_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_427" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> caught the back
of his knees, and over he went on to the floor behind.
There was a dead silence over the whole school; never
before and never again while Tom was at school did the
Doctor strike a boy in lesson. The provocation must
have been great. However, the victim had saved his
form<a name="FNanchor_13_428" id="FNanchor_13_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_428" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> for that occasion, for the Doctor turned to the top
bench, and put on the best boys for the rest of the hour;
and though, at the end of the lesson, he gave them all
such a rating<a name="FNanchor_14_429" id="FNanchor_14_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_429" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> as they did not forget, this terrible field-day
passed over without any severe visitations in the shape of
punishments or floggings. Forty young scapegraces expressed
their thanks to the "sorrowful wolf," in their
different ways before second lesson.</p>

<p>But a character for steadiness once gone is not easily
recovered, as Tom found, and for years afterward he went
up the school without it, and the masters' hands were
against him and his against them. And he regarded
them, as a matter of course, as his natural enemies.</p>

<h4>MISRULE AND ITS CAUSES.</h4>

<p>Matters were not so comfortable either in the house as
they had been, for Old Brooke left at Christmas, and one
or two others of the sixth-form boys at the following
Easter. Their rule had been rough, but strong and just
in the main, and a higher standard was beginning to be
set up; in fact, there had been a short foretaste of the
good time which followed some years later. Just now,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
however, all threatened to return into darkness and chaos
again. For the new pr&aelig;postors were either small young
boys, whose cleverness had carried them up to the top of
the school while, in strength of body and character, they
were not yet fit for a share in the government; or else big
fellows of the wrong sort, boys whose friendships and
tastes had a downward tendency, who had not caught the
meaning of their position and work, and felt none of its
responsibilities. So under this no-government the School-house
began to see bad times. The big fifth-form boys,
who were a sporting and drinking set, soon began to usurp
power, and to fag the little boys as if they were pr&aelig;postors,
and to bully and oppress any one who showed signs
of resistance. The bigger sort of sixth-form boys just described
soon made common cause with the fifth, while the
smaller sort, hampered by their colleagues'<a name="FNanchor_15_430" id="FNanchor_15_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_430" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> desertion to
the enemy, could not make head against them. So the
fags were without their lawful masters and protectors, and
ridden over rough-shod by a set of boys whom they were
not bound to obey, and whose only right over them stood
in their bodily powers; and, as Old Brooke had prophesied,
the house by degrees broke up into small sets and parties,
and lost the strong feeling of fellowship which he set so
much store by, and with it much of the prowess in games,
and the lead in all school matters, which he had done so
much to keep up.</p>

<h4>THE OLD BOY MORALIZETH THEREON.</h4>

<p>In no place in the world has individual character more
weight than at a public school. Remember this, I beseech
you, all you boys who are getting into the upper forms.
Now is the time, in all your lives, probably, when you may
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
have more wide influence, for good or evil, on the society
you live in, than you ever can have again. Quit<a name="FNanchor_16_431" id="FNanchor_16_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_431" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> yourselves
like men, then; speak up, and strike out if necessary
for whatsoever is true, and manly, and lovely, and of good
report; never try to be popular, but only to do your duty
and help others to do theirs, and you may leave the tone
of feeling in the school higher than you found it, and so
be doing good, which no living soul can measure, to generations
of your countrymen yet unborn. For boys follow
one another in herds like sheep, for good or evil; they
hate thinking, and have rarely any settled principles.
Every school, indeed, has its own traditionary standard
of right and wrong, which cannot be transgressed with
impunity, marking certain things as low and blackguard,
and certain others as lawful and right. This standard is
ever varying, though it changes only slowly, and little by
little; and, subject only to such standard, it is the leading
boys for the time being who give the tone to all the rest,
and make the school either a noble institution for the training
of Christian Englishmen, or a place where a young
boy will get more evil than he would if he were turned
out to make his way in London streets, or anything between
these two extremes.</p>

<p>The change for the worse in the School-house, however,
didn't press very heavily on our youngsters for some time;
they were in a good bedroom, where slept the only pr&aelig;postor
left who was able to keep thorough order, and their
study was in his passage; so, though they were fagged
more or less, and occasionally kicked or cuffed by the
bullies, they were, on the whole, well off; and the fresh,
brave school-life, so full of games, adventures, and good
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
fellowship, so ready at forgetting, so capacious at enjoying,
so bright at forecasting, outweighed a thousandfold
their troubles with the master of their form, and the occasional
ill-usage of the big boys in the house. It wasn't
till some year or so after the events recorded above, that
the pr&aelig;postor of their room and passage left. None of
the other sixth-form boys would move into their passage,
and, to the disgust and indignation of Tom and East, one
morning after breakfast they were seized upon by Flashman,
and made to carry down his books and furniture
into the unoccupied study which he had taken. From
this time they began to feel the weight of the tyranny of
Flashman and his friends, and, now that trouble had come
home to their own doors, began to look out for sympathizers
and partners amongst the rest of the fags; and meetings
of the oppressed began to be held, and murmurs to
arise, and plots to be laid, as to how they should free
themselves and be avenged on their enemies.</p>

<h4>THE SHOE BEGINS TO PINCH.</h4>

<p>While matters were in this state, East and Tom were
one evening sitting in their study. They had done their
work for first lesson, and Tom was in a brown study,
brooding like a young William Tell, upon the wrongs of
fags in general, and his own in particular.</p>

<p>"I say, Scud," said he, at last, rousing himself to snuff
the candle, "what right have the fifth-form boys to fag
us as they do?"</p>

<p>"No more right than you have to fag them," answered
East, without looking up from an early number of "Pickwick,"<a name="FNanchor_17_432" id="FNanchor_17_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_432" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
which was just coming out, and which he was
luxuriously devouring, stretched on his back on the sofa.</p>

<p>Tom relapsed into his brown study, and East went on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
reading and chuckling. The contrast of the boys' faces
would have given infinite amusement to a looker-on, the
one so solemn and big with mighty purpose, the other
radiant and bubbling over with fun.</p>

<p>"Do you know, old fellow, I've been thinking it over
a good deal," began Tom, again.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I know, fagging you are thinking of. Hang
it all&mdash;but listen here, Tom&mdash;here's fun. Mr. Winkle's
horse&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And I've made up my mind," broke in Tom, "that
I won't fag except for the sixth."</p>

<p>"Quite right, too, my boy," cried East, putting his
finger on the place and looking up; "but a pretty peck
of troubles you'll get into, if you're going to play that
game. However, I'm all for a strike myself, if we can
get others to join&mdash;it's getting too bad."</p>

<p>"Can't we get some sixth-form fellow to take it up?"
asked Tom.</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps we might; Morgan would interfere, I
think. Only," added East, after a moment's pause, "you
see we should have to tell him about it, and that's against
school principles. Don't you remember what old Brooke
said about learning to take our own parts?"</p>

<p>"Ah, I wish old Brooke were back again&mdash;it was all
right in his time."</p>

<p>"Why, yes, you see then the strongest and best fellows
were in the sixth, and the fifth-form fellows were afraid of
them, and they kept good order; but now our sixth-form
fellows are too small, and the fifth don't care for them,
and do what they like in the house."</p>

<p>"And so we get a double set of masters," cried Tom,
indignantly; "the lawful ones, who are responsible to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
Doctor at any rate, and the unlawful&mdash;the tyrants, who
are responsible to nobody."</p>

<p>"Down with the tyrants!" cried East; "I'm all for law
and order, and hurra for a revolution!"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't mind if it were only for young Brooke
now," said Tom, "he's such a good-hearted, gentlemanly
fellow, and ought to be in the sixth&mdash;I'd do anything for
him. But that blackguard Flashman, who never speaks
to one without a kick or an oath&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The cowardly brute," broke in East, "how I hate him!
And he knows it too&mdash;he knows that you and I think
him a coward. What a bore that he's got a study in this
passage! Don't you hear them now at supper in his den?
Brandy punch going, I'll bet. I wish the Doctor would
come out and catch him. We must change our study as
soon as we can."</p>

<p>"Change or no change, I'll never fag for him again,"
said Tom, thumping the table.</p>

<h4>THE EXPLOSION.</h4>

<p>"Fa-a-a-ag!" sounded along the passage from Flashman's
study. The two boys looked at one another in
silence. It had struck nine, so the regular night fags had
left duty, and they were the nearest to the supper-party.
East sat up, and began to look comical, as he always did
under difficulties.</p>

<p>"Fa-a-a-ag!" again. No answer.</p>

<p>"Here, Brown! East! you cursed young skulks,"
roared out Flashman, coming to his open door, "I know
you are in&mdash;no shirking."</p>

<p>Tom stole to their door, and drew the bolts as noiselessly
as he could; East blew out the candle. "Barricade
the first," whispered he. "Now, Tom, mind, no surrender."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>
<p>"Trust me for that," said Tom, between his teeth.</p>

<h4>THE SIEGE.</h4>

<p>In another minute they heard the supper-party turn
out and come down the passage to their door. They held
their breath, and heard whispering, of which they only
made out Flashman's words, "I know the young brutes
are in."</p>

<p>Then came summonses to open, which being unanswered,
the assault commenced; luckily the door was a good strong
oak one, and resisted the united weight of Flashman's
party. A pause followed, and they heard a besieger
remark, "They are in safe enough&mdash;don't you see how
the door holds at top and bottom? so the bolts must be
drawn. We should have forced the lock long ago."
East gave Tom a nudge, to call attention to this scientific
remark.</p>

<p>Then came attacks on particular panels, one of which
at last gave way to the repeated kicks; but it broke inward,
and the broken pieces got jammed across, the door
being lined with green baize, and couldn't easily be removed
from outside; and the besieged, scorning further
concealment, strengthened their defences by pressing the
end of their sofa against the door. So, after one or two
more ineffectual efforts, Flashman &amp; Co. retired, vowing
vengeance in no mild terms.</p>

<p>The first danger over, it only remained for the besieged
to effect a safe retreat, as it was now near bed-time. They
listened intently, and heard the supper-party resettle themselves,
and then gently drew back first one bolt and then
the other. Presently the convivial<a name="FNanchor_18_433" id="FNanchor_18_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_433" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> noises began again
steadily. "Now, then, stand by for a run," said East,
throwing the door wide open, and rushing into the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
passage, closely followed by Tom. They were too quick to
be caught, but Flashman was on the lookout, and sent
an empty pickle-jar whizzing after them, which narrowly
missed Tom's head, and broke into twenty pieces at the
end of the passage. "He wouldn't mind killing one, if
he wasn't caught," said East, as they turned the corner.</p>

<h4>THE REBELS IN COUNCIL.</h4>

<p>There was no pursuit, so the two turned into the hall,
where they found a knot of small boys around the fire.
Their story was told&mdash;the war of independence had
broken out&mdash;who would join the revolutionary forces?
several others present bound themselves not to fag for the
fifth form at once. One or two only edged off, and left
the rebels. What else could they do? "I've a good mind
to go to the Doctor straight," said Tom.</p>

<p>"That'll never do&mdash;don't you remember the levy<a name="FNanchor_19_434" id="FNanchor_19_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_434" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> of
the School last half?" put in another.</p>

<p>In fact, the solemn assembly, a levy of the School, had
been held, at which the captain of the School had got up,
and, after premising<a name="FNanchor_20_435" id="FNanchor_20_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_435" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> that several instances had occurred
of matters having been reported to the masters, that this
was against public morality and school tradition; that a
levy of the sixth had been held on the subject, and they
had resolved that the practice must be stopped at once;
and given out that any boy, in whatever form, who should
thenceforth appeal to a master, without having first gone
to some pr&aelig;postor and laid the case before him, should be
thrashed publicly and sent to Coventry.<a name="FNanchor_21_436" id="FNanchor_21_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_436" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<h4>A COUNSELLOR OF THE REBELS</h4>

<p>"Well, then, let's try the sixth. Try Morgan," suggested
another. "No use"&mdash;"Babbling won't do," was
the general feeling.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>
<p>"I'll give you fellows a piece of advice," said a voice
from the end of the hall. They all turned with a start,
and the speaker got up from a bench on which he had
been lying unobserved, and gave himself a shake; he was
a big, loose-made fellow, with huge limbs which had
grown too far through his jacket and trousers. "Don't
you go to anybody at all&mdash;you just stand out; say you
won't fag&mdash;they'll soon get tired of licking you. I've
tried it on years ago with their forerunners."</p>

<p>"No! did you? tell us how it was," cried a chorus of
voices, as they clustered round him.</p>

<p>"Well, just as it is with you. The fifth form would
fag us, and I and some more struck, and we beat 'em.
The good fellows left off directly, and the bullies who
kept on soon got afraid."</p>

<p>"Was Flashman here then?"</p>

<p>"Yes! and a dirty little snivelling, sneaking fellow he
was too. He never dared join us, and used to toady<a name="FNanchor_22_437" id="FNanchor_22_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_437" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> the
bullies by offering to fag for them, and peaching<a name="FNanchor_23_438" id="FNanchor_23_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_438" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> against
the rest of us."</p>

<p>"Why wasn't he cut,<a name="FNanchor_24_439" id="FNanchor_24_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_439" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> then?" said East.</p>

<p>"Oh, toadies never get cut, they're too useful. Besides,
he has no end of great hampers from home, with wine
and game in them; so he toadied and fed himself into
favor."</p>

<h4>"THE MUCKER."</h4>

<p>The quarter-to-ten bell now rang, and the small boys
went off up-stairs, still consulting together, and praising
their new counsellor, who stretched himself out on the
bench before the hall fire again. There he lay, a very
queer specimen of boyhood, by name Diggs, and familiarly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
called "The Mucker."<a name="FNanchor_25_440" id="FNanchor_25_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_440" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> He was young for his size, and a
very clever fellow, nearly at the top of the fifth. His
friends at home, having regard, I suppose, to his age, and
not to his size and place in the School, hadn't put him into
tails;<a name="FNanchor_26_441" id="FNanchor_26_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_441" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> and even his jackets were always too small; and
he had a talent for destroying clothes, and making himself
look shabby. He wasn't on terms with Flashman's set, who
sneered at his dress and ways behind his back, which he
knew, and revenged himself by asking Flashman the most
disagreeable questions, and treating him familiarly whenever
a crowd of boys were around him. Neither was he
intimate with any of the other bigger boys, who were
warned off by his oddnesses, for he was a very queer fellow;
besides, amongst other failings, he had that of impecuniosity<a name="FNanchor_27_442" id="FNanchor_27_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_442" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
in a remarkable degree. He brought as much
money as other boys to school, but got rid of it in no time,
no one knew how. And then, being also reckless, borrowed
from any one, and when his debts accumulated and
creditors pressed, would have an auction in the Hall of
everything he possessed in the world, selling even his
schoolbooks, candlestick, and study table. For weeks
after one of these auctions, having rendered his study
uninhabitable, he would live about in the fifth-form room
and hall, doing his verses on old letter-backs and odd
scraps of paper, and learning his lessons no one knew how.
He never meddled with any little boy, and was popular
with them, though they all looked on him with a sort of
compassion, and called him "poor Diggs," not being able
to resist appearances, or to disregard wholly even the
sneers of their enemy Flashman. However, he seemed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
equally indifferent to the sneers of big boys and the pity
of small ones, and lived his own queer life with much
apparent enjoyment to himself. It is necessary to introduce
Diggs thus particularly, as he not only did Tom and
East good service in their present warfare, as is about to
be told, but soon afterward, when he got into the sixth,
chose them for his fags, and excused them from study-fagging,<a name="FNanchor_28_443" id="FNanchor_28_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_443" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
thereby earning unto himself eternal gratitude
from them, and all who are interested in their history.</p>

<h4>THE WAR RAGES.</h4>

<p>And seldom had small boys more need of a friend, for
the morning after the siege the storm burst upon the
rebels in all its violence. Flashman laid wait, and caught
Tom before second lesson, and receiving a point blank
"No" when told to fetch his hat, seized him and twisted
his arm, and went through the other methods of torture
in use. "He couldn't make me cry, tho'," as Tom said
triumphantly to the rest of the rebels, "and I kicked his
shins well, I know." And soon it crept out that a lot of
the fags were in league, and Flashman excited his associates
to join him in bringing the young vagabonds to
their senses; and the house was filled with constant
chasings, and sieges, and lickings of all sorts; and in
return, the bullies' beds were pulled to pieces, and
drenched with water, and their names written upon the
walls with every insulting epithet which the fag invention
could furnish. The war in short raged fiercely; but soon,
as Diggs had told them, all the better fellows in the fifth
gave up trying to fag them, and public feeling began to
set against Flashman and his two or three intimates, and
they were obliged to keep their doings more secret, but,
being thorough bad fellows, missed no opportunity of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
torturing in private. Flashman was an adept in all ways,
but above all in the power of saying cutting and cruel
things, and could often bring tears to the eyes of boys in
this way, which all the thrashings in the world wouldn't
have wrung from them.</p>

<p>And as his operations were being cut short in other
directions, he now devoted himself chiefly to Tom and
East, who lived at his own door, and would force himself
into their study whenever he found a chance, and sit
there, sometimes alone, and sometimes with a companion,
interrupting all their work, and exulting in the evident
pain which every now and then he could see he was inflicting
on one or the other.</p>

<p>The storm had cleared the air for the rest of the house,
and a better state of things now began than there had
been since old Brooke had left; but an angry, dark spot
of thunder-cloud still hung over the end of the passage,
where Flashman's study and that of East and Tom lay.</p>

<p>He felt that they had been the first rebels, and that the
rebellion had been to a great extent successful; but what
above all stirred the hatred and bitterness of his heart
against them was that, in the frequent collisions which
there had been of late, they had openly called him coward
and sneak,&mdash;the taunts were too true to be forgiven.
While he was in the act of thrashing them they would
roar out instances of his funking at foot-ball, or shirking
some encounter with a lout of half his own size. These
things were all well enough known in the house, but to
have his own disgrace shouted out by small boys, to feel
that they despised him, to be unable to silence them by
any amount of torture, and to see the open laugh and
sneer of his own associates (who were looking on, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
took no trouble to hide their scorn from him, though they
neither interfered with his bullying nor lived a bit the less
intimately with him) made him beside himself. Come what
might, he would make those boys' lives miserable. So the
strife settled down into a personal affair between Flashman
and our youngsters; a war to the knife, to be fought
out in the little cockpit<a name="FNanchor_29_444" id="FNanchor_29_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_444" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> at the end of the bottom passage.</p>

<h4>THE WEAK TO THE WALL.</h4>

<p>Flashman, be it said, was about seventeen years old, and
big and strong of his age. He played well at all games
where pluck wasn't much wanted, and managed generally
to keep up appearances where it was; and having a bluff,
off-hand manner, which passed for heartiness, and considerable
powers of being pleasant when he liked, went
down with the school in general for a good fellow enough.
Even in the School-house, by dint of his command of
money, the constant supply of good things which he kept
up, and his adroit toadyism, he had managed to make
himself not only tolerated, but rather popular amongst
his own contemporaries; although young Brooke scarcely
spoke to him, and one or two others of the right sort
showed their opinion of him whenever a chance offered.
But the wrong sort happened to be in the ascendant just
now, and so Flashman was a formidable enemy for small
boys. This soon became plain enough. Flashman left
no slander unspoken, and no deed undone which could in
any way hurt his victims, or isolate them from the rest of
the house. One by one most of the other rebels fell away
from them, while Flashman's cause prospered, and several
other fifth-form boys began to look black at them and ill-treat
them as they passed about the house. By keeping
out of bounds, or at all events out of the house and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
quadrangle, all day, and carefully barring themselves in
at night, East and Tom managed to hold on without feeling
very miserable; but it was as much as they could do.
Greatly were they drawn then toward old Diggs, who, in
an uncouth way, began to take a good deal of notice of
them, and once or twice came to their study when Flashman
was there, who immediately decamped in consequence.
The boys thought that Diggs must have been watching.</p>

<h4>DIGGS'S BANKRUPTCY.</h4>

<p>When, therefore, about this time, an auction was one
night announced to take place in the Hall, at which,
amongst the superfluities of other boys, all Diggs's Penates<a name="FNanchor_30_445" id="FNanchor_30_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_445" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
for the time being were going to the hammer, East and
Tom laid their heads together, and resolved to devote
their ready cash (some four shillings sterling<a name="FNanchor_31_446" id="FNanchor_31_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_446" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>) to redeem
such articles as that sum would cover. Accordingly, they
duly attended to bid, and Tom became the owner of two
lots of Diggs's things: Lot 1, price one-and-threepence,
consisting (as the auctioneer remarked) of a "valuable
assortment of old metals," in the shape of a mouse-trap,
a cheese-toaster without a handle, and a sauce-pan;<a name="FNanchor_32_447" id="FNanchor_32_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_447" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Lot
2, a villanous dirty table-cloth and green-baize curtain:
while East, for one-and-sixpence purchased a leather
paper-case, with a lock but no key, once handsome, but
now much the worse for wear. But they had still the
point to settle, of how to get Diggs to take the things
without hurting his feelings. This they solved by leaving
them in his study, which was never locked when he was out.
Diggs, who had attended the auction, remembered who had
bought the lots and came to their study soon after, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
sat silent for some time, cracking his great red finger-joints.
Then he laid hold of their verses,<a name="FNanchor_33_448" id="FNanchor_33_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_448" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> and began looking
over and altering them, and at last got up, and turning
his back to them, said: "You're uncommon good-hearted
little beggars,<a name="FNanchor_34_449" id="FNanchor_34_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_449" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> you two&mdash;I value that paper-case; my
sister gave it me last holidays&mdash;I won't forget;" and so
tumbled out into the passage, leaving them somewhat embarrassed,
but not sorry that he knew what they had done.</p>

<h4>THE DERBY LOTTERY.</h4>

<p>The next morning was Saturday, the day on which the
allowances of one shilling a week were paid, an important
event to spendthrift youngsters; and great was the disgust
amongst the small fry, to hear that all the allowances
had been impounded for the Derby<a name="FNanchor_35_450" id="FNanchor_35_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_450" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> lottery. That great
event in the English year, the Derby, was celebrated at
Rugby in those days by many lotteries. It was not an
improving custom, I own, gentle reader, and led to making
books<a name="FNanchor_36_451" id="FNanchor_36_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_451" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> and betting, and other objectionable results;
but when our great Houses of Palaver<a name="FNanchor_37_452" id="FNanchor_37_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_452" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> think it right to
stop the nation's business on that day, and many of the
members bet heavily themselves, can you blame us boys
for following the example of our betters?&mdash;at any rate
we did follow it. First, there was the Great School lottery,
where the first prize was six or seven pounds; then each
house had one or more separate lotteries. These were all
nominally<a name="FNanchor_38_453" id="FNanchor_38_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_453" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> voluntary,
no boy being compelled to put in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
his shilling who didn't choose to do so; but besides Flashman,
there were three or four other fast sporting young
gentlemen in the School-house, who considered subscription
a matter of duty and necessity, and so to make their
duty come easy to the small boys, quietly secured the
allowances in a lump when given out for distribution, and
kept them. It was no use grumbling&mdash;so many fewer
tartlets and apples were eaten and fives'-balls bought on
that Saturday; and after locking-up, when the money
would otherwise have been spent, consolation was carried
to many a small boy, by the sound of the night-fags
shouting along the passages, "Gentlemen sportsmen of
the School-house, the lottery's going to be drawn in the
Hall." It was pleasant to be called a gentleman sportsman&mdash;also
to have a chance of drawing a favorite horse.<a name="FNanchor_39_454" id="FNanchor_39_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_454" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>The Hall was full of boys, and at the head of one of the
long tables stood the sporting interest, with a hat before
them in which were the tickets folded up. One of them
then began calling out a list of the house; each boy as his
name was called drew a ticket from the hat and opened
it; and most of the bigger boys, after drawing, left the
Hall directly to go back to their studies or the fifth-form
room. The sporting interest had all drawn blanks, and
they were sulky accordingly; neither of the favorites had
yet been drawn, and it had come down to the upper
fourth. So now, as each small boy came up and drew his
ticket, it was seized and opened by Flashman, or some
others of the standers-by. But no great favorite is drawn
until it comes to the Tadpole's turn, and he shuffles up,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
and draws, and tries to make off, but is caught, and his
ticket is opened like the rest.</p>

<p>"Here you are! Wanderer! third favorite," shouts the
opener.</p>

<p>"I say, just give me my ticket, please," remonstrates
Tadpole.</p>

<p>"Hullo, don't be in a hurry," breaks in Flashman,
"what'll you sell Wanderer for now?"</p>

<p>"I don't want to sell," rejoins Tadpole.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't you? Now listen, you young fool&mdash;you
don't know anything about it; the horse is no use to you.
He won't win, but I want him as a hedge.<a name="FNanchor_40_455" id="FNanchor_40_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_455" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Now I'll give
you half-a-crown<a name="FNanchor_41_456" id="FNanchor_41_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_456" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> for him." Tadpole holds out, but between
threats and cajoleries<a name="FNanchor_42_457" id="FNanchor_42_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_457" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> at length sells half for one-shilling-and-sixpence,
about a fifth of its fair market
value; however, he is glad to realize anything, and as he
wisely remarks: "Wanderer mayn't win, and the tizzy<a name="FNanchor_43_458" id="FNanchor_43_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_458" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
is safe anyhow."</p>

<h4>TOM DRAWS THE FAVORITE.</h4>

<p>East presently comes up, and draws a blank. Soon
after comes Tom's turn; his ticket, like the others, is
seized and opened. "Here you are then," shouts the
opener, holding it up: "Harkaway! By Jove, Flashy,
your young friend's in luck."</p>

<p>"Give me the ticket," says Flashman with an oath, leaning
across the table with open hand, and his face black
with rage.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you like it?" replies the opener, not a bad
fellow at the bottom, and no admirer of Flashman. "Here,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
Brown, catch hold," and he hands the ticket to
Tom, who pockets it; whereupon Flashman makes for the
door at once, that Tom and the ticket may not escape,
and there keeps watch until the drawing is over, and all
the boys are gone, except the sporting set of five or six,
who stay to compare books, make bets and so on; Tom,
who doesn't choose to move while Flashman is at the door,
and East, who stays by his friend, anticipating trouble.</p>

<p>The sporting set now gathered around Tom. Public
opinion wouldn't allow them actually to rob him of his
ticket, but any humbug or intimidation by which he
could be driven to sell the whole or part at an under value
was lawful.</p>

<p>"Now, young Brown, come, what'll you sell me Harkaway
for? I hear he isn't going to start. I'll give you
five shillings for him," begins the boy who had opened
the ticket. Tom, remembering his good deed, and moreover
in his forlorn state wishing to make a friend, is about
to accept the offer, when another cries out, "I'll give you
seven shillings." Tom hesitated and looked from one to
the other.</p>

<p>"No, no!" said Flashman, pushing in, "leave me to
deal with him; we'll draw lots for it afterward. Now,
sir, you know me&mdash;you'll sell Harkaway to us for five
shillings, or you'll repent it."</p>

<p>"I won't sell a bit of him," answered Tom shortly.</p>

<p>"You hear that now!" said Flashman, turning to the
others. "He's the coxiest<a name="FNanchor_44_459" id="FNanchor_44_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_459" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> young blackguard in the
house&mdash;I always told you so. We're to have all the trouble
and risk of getting up the lotteries for the benefit of such
fellows as he."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>
<p>Flashman forgets to explain what risks they ran, but
he speaks to willing ears. Gambling makes boys selfish
and cruel as well as men.</p>

<p>"That's true&mdash;we always draw blanks," cried one.
"Now, sir, you shall sell half, at any rate."</p>

<p>"I won't," said Tom, flushing up to his hair, and
lumping them all in his mind with his sworn enemy.</p>

<h4>ROASTING A FAG.</h4>

<p>"Very well, then, let's roast him," cried Flashman,
and catches hold of Tom by the collar; one or two of the
boys hesitate, but the rest join in. East seizes Tom's
arm and tries to pull him away, but he is knocked back by
one of the boys, and Tom is dragged along struggling.
His shoulders are pushed against the mantle-piece, and
he is held by main force before the fire. Poor East, in
more pain even than Tom, suddenly thinks of Diggs, and
darts off to find him. "Will you sell now for ten shillings?"
says one boy who is relenting.</p>

<p>Tom only answers by groans and struggles.</p>

<p>"I say, Flashey, he has had enough," says the same
boy, dropping the arm he holds.</p>

<p>"No, no, another turn'll do it," answers Flashman.
But poor Tom is done already, turns deadly pale, and his
head falls forward on his breast, just as Diggs, in frantic
excitement, rushes into the Hall with East at his heels.</p>

<p>"You cowardly brutes!" is all he can say as he catches
Tom from them and supports him to the Hall table.
"Good God! he's dying. Here, get some cold water&mdash;run
for the housekeeper."</p>

<p>Flashman and one or two others slink away; the rest,
ashamed and sorry, bend over Tom or run for water, while
East darts off for the housekeeper. Water comes, and
they throw it on his hands and face, and he begins to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
come to. "Mother!"&mdash;the words came feebly and slowly&mdash;"it's
very cold to-night." Poor old Diggs is blubbering
like a child. "Where am I?" goes on Tom, opening his
eyes. "Ah! I remember now," and he shut his eyes again
and groaned.</p>

<p>"I say," is whispered, "we can't do any more good, and
the housekeeper will be here in a minute," and all but one
steal away; he stays with Diggs, silent and sorrowful, and
fans Tom's face.</p>

<p>The housekeeper comes in with strong salts, and Tom
soon recovers enough to sit up. There is a smell of burning;
she examines his clothes, and looks up inquiringly.
The boys are silent.</p>

<p>"How did he come so?" No answer.</p>

<p>"There's been some bad work here," she adds, looking
very serious, "and I shall speak to the Doctor about it."
Still no answer.</p>

<p>"Hadn't we better carry him to the sick-room?" suggests
Diggs.</p>

<p>"Oh, I can walk now," says Tom; and, supported by
East and the housekeeper, goes to the sick-room. The
boy who held his ground is soon amongst the rest, who
are all in fear of their lives. "Did he peach?" "Does
she know about it?"</p>

<p>"Not a word&mdash;he's a staunch little fellow." And pausing
a moment, he adds: "I'm sick of this work: what
brutes we've been!"</p>

<p>Meantime Tom is stretched on the sofa in the housekeeper's
room, with East by his side, while she gets wine
and water and other restoratives.</p>

<p>"Are you much hurt, dear old boy?" whispered East.</p>

<p>"Only the back of my legs," answered Tom. They are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
indeed badly scorched, and part of his trousers burnt
through. But soon he is in bed with cold bandages. At
first he feels broken, and thinks of writing home and getting
taken away; and the verse of a hymn he had learned
years ago sings through his head, and he goes to sleep,
murmuring:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pblockquot"><p>
"Where the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest."<a name="FNanchor_45_460" id="FNanchor_45_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_460" class="fnanchor">[45]</a><br />
</p></div>

<h4>LAST DAYS OF THE WAR.</h4>

<p>But after a sound night's rest, the old boy-spirit comes
back again. East comes in reporting that the whole house
is with him, and he forgets everything except their old
resolve, never to be beaten by that bully Flashman.</p>

<p>Not a word could the housekeeper extract from either
of them; and though the Doctor knew all that she knew
that morning, he never knew any more.</p>

<p>I trust and believe that such scenes are not possible
now at school, and that lotteries and betting-books have
gone out; but I am writing of schools as they were in our
time, and must give the evil with the good.</p>

<h4>TOM DISCLOSES NOTHING.</h4>

<p>When Tom came back into school after a couple of
days in the sick-room, he found matters much
changed for the better, as East had led him to expect.
Flashman's brutality had disgusted most of his intimate
friends, even, and his cowardice had once more been made
plain to the house; for Diggs had encountered him on the
morning after the lottery, and after high words on both
sides had struck him, and the blow was not returned.
However, Flashey was not unused to this sort of thing, and
had lived through as awkward affairs before, and, as Diggs
had said, fed and toadied himself back into favor again.
Two or three of the boys who had helped to roast Tom came
up and begged his pardon, and thanked him for not telling
anything. Morgan sent for him, and was inclined to take
the matter up warmly, but Tom begged him not to do it;
to which he agreed, on Tom's promising to come to him at
once in the future,&mdash;a promise which I regret to say he
didn't keep. Tom kept Harkaway all to himself, and won
the second prize in the lottery, some thirty shillings, which
he and East contrived to spend in about three days, in the
purchase of pictures for their study, two new bats and a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
cricket-ball, all the best that could be got, and a supper of
sausages, kidneys, and beef-steak pies to all the rebels.
Light come, light go; they wouldn't have been comfortable
with money in their pockets in the middle of the
half.<a name="FNanchor_1_461" id="FNanchor_1_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_461" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<h4>RULE BREAKING.</h4>

<p>The embers of Flashman's wrath, however, were still
smouldering, and burst out every now and then in sly
blows and taunts, and they both felt that they hadn't
quite done with him yet. It wasn't long, however, before
the last act of that drama came, and with it the end
of bullying for Tom and East at Rugby. They now often
stole out into the Hall at nights, incited thereto, partly
by the hope of finding Diggs there and having a talk with
him, partly by the excitement of doing something which
was against the rules; for, sad to say, both of our youngsters,
since their loss of character for steadiness in their
form, had got into the habit of doing things which were
forbidden, as a matter of adventure; just in the same
way, I should fancy, as men fall into smuggling, and for
the same sort of reasons,&mdash;thoughtlessness in the first
place. It never occurred to them to consider why such
and such rules were laid down; the reason was nothing
to them, and they only looked upon rules as a sort of challenge
from the rule-makers, which it would be rather bad
pluck in them not to accept; and then again, in the lower
parts of the school they hadn't enough to do. The work
of the form they could manage to get through pretty
easily, keeping a good enough place to get their regular
yearly remove; and not having much ambition beyond
this, their whole superfluous steam was available for games
and scrapes. Now, one rule of the house which it was a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
daily pleasure of all such boys to break, was that after
supper all fags, except the three on duty in the passages,
should remain in their own studies until nine o'clock;
and if caught about the passages or Hall, or in one another's
studies, they were liable to punishments or caning.
The rule was stricter than its observance; for most of the
sixth spent their evenings in the fifth-form room, where
the library was, and the lessons were learnt in common.
Every now and then, however, a pr&aelig;postor would be
seized with a fit of district visiting, and would take a tour
of the passages and Hall, and the fags' studies. Then,
if the owner were entertaining a friend or two, the first
kick at the door and ominous<a name="FNanchor_2_462" id="FNanchor_2_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_462" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> "Open here" had the effect
of the shadow of a hawk over a chicken-yard; every one
cut to cover<a name="FNanchor_3_463" id="FNanchor_3_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_463" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>&mdash;one small boy diving under the sofa, another
under the table, while the owner would hastily pull
down a book or two and open them, and cry out in a meek
voice: "Hullo, who's there?" casting an anxious eye
round, to see that no protruding leg or elbow could betray
the hidden boys. "Open, sir, directly; it's Snooks." "Oh,
I'm very sorry; I didn't know it was you, Snooks;" and
then with well-feigned zeal, the door would be opened,
young Hopeful praying that that beast Snooks mightn't
have heard the scuffle caused by his coming. If a study
was empty, Snooks proceeded to draw<a name="FNanchor_4_464" id="FNanchor_4_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_464" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> the passages and
Hall to find the truants.</p>

<h4>THE BRUISED WORM WILL TURN.</h4>

<p>Well, one evening, in forbidden hours, Tom and East
were in the Hall. They occupied the seats before the fire
nearest the door, while Diggs sprawled, as usual, before
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
the further fire. He was busy with a copy of verses, and
East and Tom were chatting together in whispers, by the
light of the fire, and splicing a favorite old fives'-bat which
had sprung.<a name="FNanchor_5_465" id="FNanchor_5_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_465" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Presently a step came down the bottom
passage; they listened a moment, assured themselves that
it wasn't a pr&aelig;postor, and then went on with their work,
and the door swung open, and in walked Flashman. He
didn't see Diggs, and thought it a good chance to keep his
hand in; and as the boys didn't move for him, struck one
of them, to make them get out of his way.</p>

<p>"What's that for?" growled the assaulted one.</p>

<p>"Because I choose. You've no business here; go to
your study."</p>

<p>"You can't send us."</p>

<p>"Can't I? Then I'll thrash you if you stay," said Flashman,
savagely.</p>

<p>"I say, you two," said Diggs, from the end of the Hall,
rousing up and resting himself on his elbow, "you'll never
get rid of that fellow till you lick him. Go in at him,
both of you&mdash;I'll see fair play."</p>

<h4>ACCOUNTS SQUARED WITH FLASHMAN.</h4>

<p>Flashman was taken aback, and retreated two steps.
East looked at Tom. "Shall we try?" said he. "Yes,"
said Tom, desperately. So the two advanced on Flashman,
with clenched fists and beating hearts. They were
about up to his shoulder, but tough boys of their age, and
in perfect training; while he, though strong and big, was
in poor condition from his monstrous habit of stuffing and
want of exercise. Coward as he was, however, Flashman
couldn't swallow such an insult as this; besides, he was
confident of having easy work, and so faced the boys, saying,
"You impudent young blackguards!" Before he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
could finish his abuse they rushed in on him, and began
pummelling at all of him which they could reach. He hit
out wildly and savagely, but the full force of his blows
didn't tell; they were too near him. It was long odds,
though, in point of strength, and in another minute Tom
went plunging backward over the form, and Flashman
turned to demolish East with a savage grin. But now
Diggs jumped down from the table on which he had seated
himself. "Stop there," shouted he, "the round's over&mdash;half
a minute time allowed."</p>

<p>"What the&mdash;&mdash;is it to you?" faltered Flashman, who
began to lose heart.</p>

<p>"I'm going to see fair, I tell you," said Diggs, with a
grin, and snapping his great red fingers; "'tisn't fair for
you to be fighting one of them at a time. Are you ready,
Brown? Time's up."</p>

<p>The small boys rushed in again. Closing they saw was
their best chance, and Flashman was wilder and more
flurried than ever; he caught East by the throat, and
tried to force him back on the iron-bound table; Tom
grasped his waist, and remembering the old throw he had
learned in the Vale from Harry Winburn, crooked his leg
inside Flashman's, and threw his weight forward. The
three tottered for a moment, then over they went on to
the floor, Flashman striking his head against a form in
the Hall.</p>

<h4>PENALTIES OF WAR.</h4>

<p>The two youngsters sprang to their legs, but he lay
there still. They began to be frightened. Tom stooped
down, and then cried out, scared out of his wits, "He's
bleeding awfully; come here, East, Diggs&mdash;he's dying!"</p>

<p>"Not he," said Diggs, getting leisurely off the table;
"it's all sham&mdash;he's only afraid to fight it out."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>
<p>East was as frightened as Tom. Diggs lifted Flashman's
head, and he groaned.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" shouted Diggs.</p>

<p>"My skull's fractured," sobbed Flashman.</p>

<p>"Oh, let me run for the housekeeper," cried Tom. "What
shall we do!"</p>

<p>"Fiddlesticks! it's nothing but the skin broken," said
the relentless Diggs, feeling his head. "Cold water and
a bit of rag's all he'll want."</p>

<p>"Let me go," said Flashman, surlily, sitting up; "I
don't want your help."</p>

<p>"We're really very sorry," began East.</p>

<p>"Hang your sorrow," answered Flashman, holding his
handkerchief to the place; "you shall pay for this, I can
tell you, both of you." And he walked out of the Hall.</p>

<p>"He can't be very bad," said Tom, with a deep sigh,
much relieved to see his enemy march so well.</p>

<p>"Not he," said Diggs, "and you'll see you won't be
troubled with him any more. But, I say, your head's
broken too&mdash;your collar is covered with blood."</p>

<p>"Is it, though?" said Tom, putting up his hand; "I
didn't know it."</p>

<p>"Well, mop it up, or you'll have your jacket spoilt.
And you have got a bad eye, Scud; you'd better go and
bathe it well in cold water."</p>

<p>"Cheap enough, too, if we've done with our old friend
Flashey," said East, as they made up-stairs to bathe their
wounds.</p>

<p>They had done with Flashman in one sense, for he
never laid finger on either of them again; but whatever
harm a spiteful heart and venomous tongue could do
them, he took care should be done. Only throw dirt
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
enough, and some of it is sure to stick; and so it was with
the fifth form and the bigger boys in general, with whom
he associated more or less, and they not at all. Flashman
managed to get Tom and East into disfavor, which did
not wear off for some time after the author of it had disappeared
from the School world. This event, much prayed
for by the small fry in general, took place a few months
after the above encounter. One fine summer evening,
Flashman had been regaling himself on gin-punch, at
Brownsover; and having exceeded his usual limits, started
home uproarious. He fell in with a friend or two coming
back from bathing, proposed a glass of beer, to which they
assented, the weather being hot, and they thirsty souls,
and unaware of the quantity of drink which Flashman
had already on board. The short result was, that Flashey
became beastly drunk; they tried to get him along, but
couldn't; so they chartered<a name="FNanchor_6_466" id="FNanchor_6_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_466" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> a hurdle<a name="FNanchor_7_467" id="FNanchor_7_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_467" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and two men to
carry him. One of the masters came upon them and they
naturally enough fled. The flight of the rest raised the
master's suspicions, and the good angel of the fags incited
him to examine the freight, and, after examination, to
convoy the hurdle himself up to the School-house; and
the Doctor, who had long had his eye on Flashman, arranged
for his withdrawal next morning.</p>

<h4>FATE OF LIBERATORS.</h4>

<p>The evil that men, and boys, too, do, lives after them.
Flashman was gone, but our boys, as hinted above, still
felt the effects of his hate. Besides, they had been the
movers of the strike against unlawful fagging. The cause
was righteous,&mdash;the result had been triumphant to a great
extent; but the best of the fifth, even those who had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
never fagged the small boys, or had given up the practice
cheerfully, couldn't help feeling a small grudge against
the first rebels. After all, their form had been defied&mdash;on
just grounds, no doubt; so just indeed, that they had
at once acknowledged the wrong, and remained passive
in the strife; had they sided with Flashman and his set,
the rebels must have given way at once. They couldn't
help, on the whole, being glad that they had so acted, and
that the resistance had been successful against such of
their own form as had shown fight; they felt that law and
order had gained thereby, but the ringleaders they couldn't
quite pardon at once. "Confoundedly coxy those young
rascals will get, if we don't mind," was the general feeling.</p>

<p>So it is, and must be always, my dear boys. If the
Angel Gabriel were to come down from heaven, and head
a successful rise against the most abominable and unrighteous
vested interest<a name="FNanchor_8_468" id="FNanchor_8_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_468" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> which this poor old world
groans under, he would most certainly lose his character
for many years, probably for centuries, not only with the
upholders of said vested interest, but with the respectable
mass of the people whom he had delivered. They
wouldn't ask him to dinner, or let their names appear
with his in the papers; they would be very careful how
they spoke of him in the Palaver<a name="FNanchor_9_469" id="FNanchor_9_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_469" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> or at their clubs.
What can we expect, then, when we have only poor gallant
blundering men like Kossuth, Garibaldi, Mazzini<a name="FNanchor_10_470" id="FNanchor_10_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_470" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
and righteous causes which do not triumph in their hands,&mdash;men
who have holes enough in their armor, God knows,
easy to be hit by respectabilities sitting in their lounging
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
chairs, and having large balances<a name="FNanchor_11_471" id="FNanchor_11_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_471" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> at their bankers? But
you are brave, gallant boys, who hate easy chairs, and have
no balances or bankers. You only want to have your
heads set straight, to take the right side; so bear in mind
that majorities, especially respectable ones, are nine times
out of ten in the wrong, and that if you see a man or a
boy striving earnestly on the weak side, however wrong-headed
or blundering he may be, you are not to go and
join the cry against him. If you can't join him and help
him, and make him wiser, at any rate remember that he
has found something in the world which he will fight and
suffer for, which is just what you have got to do for yourselves;
and so think and speak of him tenderly.</p>

<h4>THE ISHMAELITES.</h4>

<p>So East, and Tom, the Tadpole, and one or two more,
became a sort of young Ishmaelites,<a name="FNanchor_12_472" id="FNanchor_12_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_472" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> their hands against
every one, and every one's hand against them. It has
been already told how they got to war with the masters
and the fifth form, and with the sixth it was much the
same. They saw the pr&aelig;postors cowed by or joining with
the fifth, and shirking their own duties; so they didn't
respect them, and rendered no willing obedience. It had
been one thing to clean out studies for sons of heroes
like old Brooke, but was quite another to do the like for
Snooks and Green, who had never faced a good scrummage
at foot-ball, and couldn't keep the passages in order
at night. So they only slurred through their fagging just
well enough to escape a licking, and not always that, and
got the character of sulky, unwilling fags. In the fifth-form
room, after supper, when such matters were often discussed
and arranged, their names were forever coming up.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>
<p>"I say, Green," Snooks began one night, "isn't that
new boy, Harrison, your fag?"</p>

<p>"Yes, why?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I know something of him at home, and should
like to excuse him; will you swop?"</p>

<p>"Who will you give me?"</p>

<p>"Well, let's see; there's Willis, Johnson&mdash;No, that
won't do. Yes, I have it, there's young East; I'll give
you him."</p>

<p>"Don't you wish you may get it?" replied Green.
"I'll give you two for Willis, if you like?"</p>

<p>"Who then?" asks Snooks.</p>

<p>"Hall and Brown."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't have 'em as a gift."</p>

<p>"Better than East, though, for they aren't quite so
sharp," said Green, getting up and leaning his back
against the mantel-piece; he wasn't a bad fellow, and
couldn't help not being able to put down the unruly fifth
form. His eye twinkled as he went on. "Did I ever
tell you how the young vagabond sold me<a name="FNanchor_13_473" id="FNanchor_13_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_473" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> last half?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;how?"</p>

<p>"Well, he never half cleaned my study out, only just
stuck the candlesticks in the cupboard, and swept the
crumbs on to the floor. So at last I was mortal angry,
and had him up, and made him go through the whole performance
under my eyes: the dust the young scamp made
nearly choked me, and showed that he hadn't swept the
carpet before. Well, when it was all finished: 'Now,
young gentleman,' says I, 'mind, I expect this to be done
every morning&mdash;floor swept, table-cloth taken off and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
shaken, and everything dusted.' 'Very well,' grunts he.
Not a bit of it, though&mdash;I was quite sure in a day or two
that he never took the table-cloth off even. So I laid a
trap for him; I tore up some paper and put half a dozen
bits on my table one night, and the cloth over them as
usual. Next morning, after breakfast, up I came, pulled
off the cloth, and sure enough there was the paper, which
fluttered down on to the floor. I was in a towering rage.
'I've got you now,' thought I, and sent for him, while I
got out my cane. Up he came, as cool as you please, with
his hands in his pockets. 'Didn't I tell you to shake my
table-cloth every morning?' roared I. 'Yes,' says he.
'Did you do it this morning?' 'Yes.' 'You young liar!
I put these pieces of paper on the table last night, and if
you'd taken the table-cloth off you'd have seen them, so
I'm going to give you a good licking.' Then my youngster
takes one hand out of his pocket, and just stoops down
and picks up two of the bits of paper, and holds them out
to me. There was written on each, in great round text:
'Harry East, his mark.' The young rogue had found my
trap out, taken away my paper, and put some of his there,
every bit ear-marked.<a name="FNanchor_14_474" id="FNanchor_14_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_474" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> I'd a great mind to lick him for
his impudence, but, after all, one has no right to be laying
traps, so I didn't. Of course I was at his mercy till the
end of the half, and in his weeks my study was so frowzy<a name="FNanchor_15_475" id="FNanchor_15_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_475" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
I couldn't sit in it."</p>

<p>"They spoil one's things so, too," chimed in a third boy.
"Hall and Brown were night-fags last week; I called fag,
and gave them my candlesticks to clean; away they went,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
and didn't appear again. When they'd had time enough
to clean them three times over I went out to look after
them. They weren't in the passages, so down I went into
the Hall where I heard music, and there I found them sitting
on the table, listening to Johnson, who was playing
the flute, and my candlesticks stuck between the bars well
into the fire, red hot, clean spoiled; they've never stood
straight since, and I must get some more. However, I
gave them both a good licking; that's one comfort."</p>

<h4>MISFORTUNE THICKENS.</h4>

<p>Such were the sort of scrapes they were always getting
into; and so, partly by their own faults, partly from circumstances,
partly from the faults of others, they found
themselves outlaws,<a name="FNanchor_16_476" id="FNanchor_16_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_476" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> ticket-of-leave men,<a name="FNanchor_17_477" id="FNanchor_17_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_477" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> or what you will
in that line; in short, dangerous parties, and lived the
sort of hand-to-mouth, wild, reckless life, which such parties
have to put up with. Nevertheless, they never quite
lost favor with young Brooke, who was now the cock of
the House,<a name="FNanchor_18_478" id="FNanchor_18_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_478" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and just getting into the sixth; and Diggs
stuck to them like a man, and gave them store of good
advice, by which they never in the least profited.</p>

<p>And even after the House mended, and law and order
had been restored, which soon happened after young
Brooke and Diggs got into the sixth, they couldn't easily
or at once return into the paths of steadiness, and many
of the old wild out-of-bounds habits stuck to them as
firmly as ever. While they had been quite little boys, the
scrapes they got into in the School hadn't much mattered
to any one; but now they were in the upper school, all
wrong-doers from which were sent up straight to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
Doctor at once; so they began to come under his notice; and
as they were a sort of leaders in a small way amongst their
own contemporaries, his eye, which was everywhere, was
upon them.</p>

<p>It was a toss-up<a name="FNanchor_19_479" id="FNanchor_19_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_479" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> whether they turned out well or ill, and
so they were just the boys who caused the most anxiety
to such a master. You have been told of the first occasion
on which they were sent up to the Doctor, and the remembrance
of it was so pleasant, that they had much less fear
of him than most boys of their standing had. "It's all
his looks," Tom used to say to East, "that frightens fellows;
don't you remember, he never said anything to us
my first half-year, for being an hour late for locking up?"</p>

<p>The next time Tom came before him, however, the interview
was of a very different kind. It happened just
about the time at which we have now arrived, and was the
first of a series of scrapes into which our hero now managed
to tumble.</p>

<h4>THE AVON.</h4>

<p>The river Avon at Rugby is a slow and not a very clear
stream, in which chub, dace, roach, and other coarse fish
are (or were) plentiful enough, together with a fair
sprinkling of small jack,<a name="FNanchor_20_480" id="FNanchor_20_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_480" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> but no fish worth sixpence either
for sport or food. It is, however, a capital river for bathing,
as it has many nice small pools and several good
reaches<a name="FNanchor_21_481" id="FNanchor_21_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_481" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> for swimming, all within about a mile of one another,
and at an easy twenty minutes' walk from the
School. This mile of water is rented, or used to be
rented, for bathing purposes, by the Trustees of the
School, for the boys. The foot-path to Brownsover<a name="FNanchor_22_482" id="FNanchor_22_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_482" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
crosses the river by "the Planks," a curious old single-plank
bridge, running for fifty or sixty yards into the flat
meadows on each side of the river, for in the winter there
are frequent floods. Above the Planks were the bathing-places
for the smaller boys,&mdash;Sleath's, the first bathing-place
where all new boys had to begin, until they had
proved to the bathing-men (three steady individuals who
were paid to attend daily through the summer to prevent
accidents) that they could swim pretty decently, when
they were allowed to go on to Anstey's, about one hundred
and fifty yards below. Here there was a hole about
six feet deep and twelve feet across, over which the puffing
urchins struggled to the opposite side, and thought no
small beer of themselves for having been out of their
depths. Below the Planks came larger and deeper holes,
the first of which was Wratislaw's, and the last Swift's, a
famous hole ten or twelve feet deep in parts, and thirty
yards across, from which there was a fine swimming reach
right down to the mill. Swift's was reserved for the
sixth and fifth forms, and had a spring-board<a name="FNanchor_23_483" id="FNanchor_23_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_483" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and two
sets of steps; the others had one set of steps each, and
were used indifferently by all the lower boys, though
each House addicted itself more to one hole than to another.
The School-house at this time affected<a name="FNanchor_24_484" id="FNanchor_24_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_484" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Wratislaw's
hole, and Tom and East, who had learnt to swim
like fishes, were to be found there as regular as the clock
through the summer always twice, and often three times a
day.</p>

<h4>DISPUTED RIGHTS OF FISHING.</h4>

<p>Now the boys either had, or fancied they had, a right
also to fish at their pleasure over the whole of this part of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
the river, and would not understand that the right (if
any) only extended to the Rugby side. As ill-luck would
have it, the gentleman who owned the opposite bank, after
allowing it for some time without interference, had ordered
his keepers<a name="FNanchor_25_485" id="FNanchor_25_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_485" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> not to let the boys fish on his side; the consequence
of which had been, that there had been first
wranglings and then fights between the keepers and boys;
and so keen had the quarrel become, that the landlord
and his keepers, after a ducking had been inflicted on one
of the latter, and a fierce fight ensued thereon, had been
up to the Great School at calling-over to identify the delinquents,
and it was all the Doctor himself and five or six
masters could do to keep the peace. Not even his authority
could prevent the hissing, and so strong was the feeling,
that the four pr&aelig;postors of the week walked up the
school with their canes, shouting s-s-s-s-i-lenc-c-c-c-e at
the top of their voices. However, the chief offenders for
the time were flogged and kept in bounds, but the victorious
party had brought a nice hornet's nest about their
ears. The landlord was hissed at the School-gates as he
rode past, and when he charged his horse at the mob of
boys, and tried to thrash them with his whip, was driven
back by cricket-bats and wickets, and pursued with pebbles
and fives'-balls; while the wretched keepers' lives
were a burden to them, from having to watch the water
so closely.</p>

<p>The School-house boys of Tom's standing, one and all
as a protest against this tyranny and cutting short of their
lawful amusements, took to fishing in all ways, and especially
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
by means of night-lines. The little tackle-maker<a name="FNanchor_26_486" id="FNanchor_26_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_486" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> at
the bottom of the town would soon have made his fortune
had the rage lasted, and several of the barbers began to
lay in fishing-tackle. The boys had this great advantage
over their enemies, that they spent a large portion of the
day in nature's garb by the river side, and so, when tired
of swimming, would get out on the other side and fish, or
set night-lines, till the keepers hove in sight, and then
plunge in and swim back and mix with the other bathers,
and the keepers were too wise to follow across the stream.</p>

<h4>CHAFFING A KEEPER.</h4>

<p>While things were in this state, one day Tom and three
or four others were bathing at Wratislaw's, and had, as a
matter of course, been taking up and resetting night-lines.
They had all left the water, and were sitting or standing
about at their toilets, in all costumes from a shirt upward,
when they were aware of a man in a velveteen shooting-coat
approaching from the other side. He was a new
keeper, so they didn't recognize or notice him, till he
pulled up right opposite and began:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I see'd some of you young gentlemen over this side a
fishing just now."</p>

<p>"Hullo, who are you? what business is that of yours,
old Velveteens?"<a name="FNanchor_27_487" id="FNanchor_27_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_487" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>"I'm the new under-keeper, and master's told me to
keep a sharp look out on all o' you young chaps. And I
tells 'ee I mean business, and you'd better keep on your
own side, or we shall fall out."</p>

<p>"Well, that's right, Velveteens&mdash;speak out and let's
know your mind at once."</p>

<p>"Look here, old boy," cried East, holding up a miserable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
coarse fish or two and a small jack, "would you like
to smell 'em, and see which bank they lived under?"</p>

<p>"I'll give you a bit of advice, keeper," shouted Tom,
who was sitting in his shirt paddling with his feet in the
river; "you'd better go down there to Swift's where the
big boys are; they're beggars<a name="FNanchor_28_488" id="FNanchor_28_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_488" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> at setting lines, and'll put
you up to a wrinkle or two for catching the five-pounders."
Tom was nearest to the keeper, and that officer, who was
getting angry at the chaff, fixed his eyes on our hero, as
if to take note of him for future use. Tom returned his
gaze with a steady stare, and then broke into a laugh,
and struck into the middle of a favorite School-house
song:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><p>
"As I and my companions<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were setting of a snare,</span><br />
The gamekeeper was watching us,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For him we did not care:</span><br />
For we can wrestle and fight, my boys,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And jump out anywhere,</span><br />
For it's my delight of a likely<a name="FNanchor_29_489" id="FNanchor_29_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_489" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> night<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the season of the year."</span><br />
</p></div>

<p>The chorus was taken up by the other boys with shouts
of laughter, and the keeper turned away with a grunt, but
evidently bent on mischief. The boys thought no more
of the matter.</p>

<p>But now came on the May-fly season; the soft, hazy
summer weather lay sleepily along the rich meadows by
Avon side, and the green and gray flies flickered with
their graceful lazy up-and-down flight over the reeds and
the water and the meadows, in myriads upon myriads.
The May-flies must surely be the lotus-eaters<a name="FNanchor_30_490" id="FNanchor_30_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_490" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
ephemer&aelig;;<a name="FNanchor_31_491" id="FNanchor_31_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_491" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> the happiest, laziest, carelessest fly that
dances and dreams out his few hours of sunshiny life by
English rivers.</p>

<p>Every little pitiful coarse fish in the Avon was on the
alert for the flies, and gorging his wretched carcass with
hundreds daily, the gluttonous rogues! and every lover
of the gentle craft was out to avenge the poor May-flies.</p>

<h4>THE RETURN MATCH WITH VELVETEENS.</h4>

<p>So one fine Thursday afternoon, Tom having borrowed
East's new rod, started by himself to the river. He fished
for some time with small success: not a fish would rise at
him; but as he prowled along the bank, he was presently
aware of mighty ones feeding in a pool on the opposite
side, under the shade of a huge willow tree. The stream
was deep here, but some fifty yards below was a shallow,
for which he made off hot-foot:<a name="FNanchor_32_492" id="FNanchor_32_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_492" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> and forgetting landlords,
keepers, solemn prohibitions of the Doctor, and everything
else, pulled up his trousers, plunged across, and in
three minutes was creeping along on all-fours toward the
clump of willows.</p>

<p>It isn't often that great chub, or any other coarse fish,
are in earnest about anything, but just then they were
thoroughly bent on feeding, and in half an hour Master
Tom had deposited three thumping fellows at the foot of
the giant willow. As he was baiting for a fourth pounder,
and just going to throw in again, he became aware of a
man coming up the bank not one hundred yards off.
Another look told him that it was the under-keeper. Could
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
he reach the shallow before him? No, not carrying
his rod. Nothing for it but the tree, so Tom laid his
bones to it, shinning up as fast as he could, and dragging
up his rod after him. He had just time to reach and
crouch along a huge branch some ten feet up, which
stretched out over the river, when the keeper arrived at
the clump. Tom's heart beat fast as he came under the
tree; two steps more and he would have passed, when, as
ill-luck would have it, the gleam on the scales of the dead
fish caught his eye, and he made a dead point at the foot
of the tree. He picked up the fish one by one; his eye
and touch told him that they had been alive and feeding
within the hour. Tom crouched lower along the branch,
and heard the keeper beating the clump. "If I could
only get the rod hidden," thought he, and began gently
shifting it to get it alongside of him: "willow-trees don't
throw out straight hickory shoots twelve feet long, with
no leaves, worse luck?" Alas! the keeper catches the
rustle, and then a sight of the rod, and then of Tom's
hand and arm.</p>

<p>"Oh, be up ther' be ee?" says he, running under the
tree. "Now you come down this minute."</p>

<p>"Treed at last," thinks Tom, making no answer, and
keeping as close as possible, but working away at the rod,
which he takes to pieces: "I'm in for it, unless I can
starve him out." And then he begins to meditate getting
along the branch for a plunge, and scramble to the other
side; but the small branches are so thick, and the opposite
bank so difficult, that the keeper will have lots of time to
get round by the ford before he can get out, so he gives
that up. And now he hears the keeper beginning to
scramble up the trunk. That will never do; so he scrambles
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
himself back to where his branch joins the trunk, and
stands with lifted rod.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Velveteens! mind your fingers if you come any
higher!"</p>

<p>The keeper stops and looks, and then with a grin says:
"Oh, be you, be it, young measter? Well, here's luck.
Now I tells ee to come down at once, and 't'll be best
for ee."</p>

<p>"Thank'ee, Velveteens, I'm very comfortable," said Tom,
shortening the rod in his hand, and preparing for battle.</p>

<p>"Werry well, please yourself," says the keeper, descending,
however, to the ground again, and taking his seat on
the bank; "I bean't in no hurry, so you may take your
time. I'll learn ee to gee<a name="FNanchor_33_493" id="FNanchor_33_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_493" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> honest folks names afore I've
done with ee."</p>

<p>"My luck as usual," thinks Tom; "what a fool I was
to give him a black.<a name="FNanchor_34_494" id="FNanchor_34_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_494" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> If I'd called him 'keeper,' now, I
might get off. The return match<a name="FNanchor_35_495" id="FNanchor_35_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_495" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> is all his way."</p>

<h4>VELVETEENS' REVENGE.</h4>

<p>The keeper quietly proceeded to take out his pipe, fill
and light it, keeping an eye on Tom, who now sat disconsolately
across the branch, looking at keeper,&mdash;a pitiful
sight for men and fishes. The more he thought of it, the
less he liked it. "It must be getting near second calling-over,"
thinks he. Keeper smokes on stolidly. "If he
takes me up, I shall be flogged safe enough. I can't sit
here all night. Wonder if he'll rise at silver."<a name="FNanchor_36_496" id="FNanchor_36_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_496" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>"I say, keeper," said he meekly, "let me go for two
bob?"<a name="FNanchor_37_497" id="FNanchor_37_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_497" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>"Not for twenty neither," grunts his persecutor.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>
<p>And so they sat on till long past second calling-over,
and the sun came slanting in through the willow branches,
and telling of locking-up near at hand.</p>

<p>"I'm coming down, keeper," said Tom at last, with a
sigh, fairly tired out. "Now, what are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"Walk ee up to school, and give ee over to the Doctor;
them's my orders," says Velveteens, knocking the ashes
out of his fourth pipe, and standing up and shaking himself.</p>

<p>"Very good," said Tom; "but hands off, you know.
I'll go with you quietly, so no collaring or that sort of
thing."</p>

<p>Keeper looked at him a minute&mdash;"Werry good," said
he, at last; and so Tom descended, and wended his way
drearily by the side of the keeper up to the School-house,
where they arrived just at locking-up. As they passed
the School-gates, the Tadpole and several others who were
standing there caught the state of things, and rushed out,
crying, "Rescue!" but Tom shook his head, so they only
followed to the Doctor's gate, and went back sorely puzzled.</p>

<p>How changed and stern the Doctor seemed from the last
time that Tom was up there, as the keeper told the story,
not omitting to state how Tom had called him blackguard
names. "Indeed, sir," broke in the culprit, "it was only
Velveteens." The Doctor only asked one question.</p>

<p>"You know the rule about the banks, Brown?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Then wait for me to-morrow, after the first lesson."</p>

<p>"I thought so," muttered Tom.</p>

<p>"And about the rod, sir?" went on the keeper. "Master's
told we as we might have all the rods&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, please, sir," broke in Tom, "the rod isn't mine."
The Doctor looked puzzled, but the keeper, who was a
good-hearted fellow, and melted at Tom's evident distress,
gave up his claim. Tom was flogged next morning, and
a few days afterward met Velveteens, and presented him
with a half a crown for giving up the rod claim, and they
became sworn friends; and I regret to say that Tom had
many more fish from under the willow that May-fly season,
and was never caught again by Velveteens.</p>

<h4>MORE SCRAPES.</h4>

<p>It wasn't three weeks before Tom, and now East by his
side, were again in the awful presence. This time, however,
the Doctor was not so terrible. A few days before,
they had been fagged at fives to fetch the balls that went
off the Court. While standing watching the game, they
saw five or six nearly new balls hit on the top of the
School. "I say, Tom," said East, when they were dismissed,
"couldn't we get those balls somehow?"</p>

<p>"Let's try, anyhow."</p>

<p>So they reconnoitered the walls carefully, borrowed a
coal-hammer from old Stumps, bought some big nails, and
after one or two attempts scaled the School, and possessed
themselves of huge quantities of fives'-balls. The place
pleased them so much that they spent all their spare time
there scratching and cutting their names on the top of
every tower; and at last, having exhausted all other
places, finished up with inscribing <span class="smcap">H. East</span>, <span class="smcap">T. Brown</span>,
on the minute-hand of the great clock. In the doing of
which, they held the minute-hand, and disturbed the
clock's economy. So next morning, when masters and
boys came trooping down to prayers, and entered the
quadrangle, the injured minute-hand was indicating three
minutes to the hour. They all pulled up, and took their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
time. When the hour struck, doors were closed, and half
the School late. Thomas being set to make inquiry, discovers
their names on the minute-hand, and reports accordingly;
and they are sent for, a knot of their friends making
derisive and pantomimic allusions to what their fate will
be, as they walk off.</p>

<p>But the Doctor, after hearing their story, doesn't make
much of it, and only gives them thirty lines of Homer to
learn by heart, and a lecture on the likelihood of such
exploits ending in broken bones.</p>

<h4>THE DOCTOR REIGNING.</h4>

<p>Alas! almost the next day was one of the great fairs in
the town; and as several rows and other disagreeable accidents
had of late taken place on these occasions, the Doctor
gives out, after prayers in the morning, that no boy is to
go down into the town. Wherefore East and Tom, for no
earthly pleasure except that of doing what they are told
not to do, start away, after second lesson, and making a
short circuit through the fields, strike a back lane which
leads into the town, go down it, and run plump upon one
of the masters as they emerge into the High Street. The
master in question, though a very clever, is not a righteous
man; he has already caught several of his own pupils, and
gives them lines to learn, while he sends East and Tom,
who are not his pupils, up to the Doctor; who, on learning
that they had been at prayers in the morning, flogs
them soundly.</p>

<p>The flogging did them no good at the time, for the injustice
of their captor was rankling in their minds; but it
was just the end of the half, and on the next evening but
one Thomas knocks at their door, and says the Doctor
wants to see them. They look at one another in silent
dismay. What can it be now? Which of their countless
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
wrong-doings can he have heard of officially? However,
it's no use delaying, so up they go to the study. There
they find the Doctor, not angry, but very grave. "He
has sent for them to speak to them very seriously before
they go home. They have each been flogged several times
in the half-year for direct and wilful breaches of rules.
This cannot go on. They are doing no good to themselves
or others, and now they are getting up in the School, and
have influence. They seem to think that rules are made
capriciously, and for the pleasure of the masters; but this
is not so, they are made for the good of the whole School,
and must and shall be obeyed. Those who thoughtlessly
or wilfully break them, will not be allowed to stay at the
School. He should be sorry if they had to leave, as the
School might do them both much good, and wishes them
to think very seriously in the holidays over what he has
said. Good-night."</p>

<p>And so the two hurry off horribly scared; the idea of
having to leave has never crossed their minds and is quite
unbearable.</p>

<p>As they go out they meet at the door old Holmes, a
sturdy, cheery pr&aelig;postor of another house, who goes in to
the Doctor; and they hear his genial, hearty greeting of
the new-comer, so different to their own reception, as the
door closes, and return to their study with heavy hearts,
and tremendous resolves to break no more rules.</p>

<p>Five minutes afterward the master of their form, a late
arrival and a model young master, knocks at the Doctor's
study-door. "Come in!" and as he enters the Doctor
goes on to Holmes&mdash;"you see I do not know anything of
the case officially; and if I take any notice of it at all, I
must publicly expel the boy. I don't wish to do that, for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
I think there is some good in him. There's nothing for
it but a good sound thrashing." He paused to shake
hands with the master, which Holmes does also, and then
prepares to leave.</p>

<p>"I understand. Good-night, sir."</p>

<p>"Good-night, Holmes. And remember," added the
Doctor, emphasizing the words, "a good sound thrashing
before the whole house."</p>

<p>The door closed on Holmes; and the Doctor, in answer
to the puzzled look of his lieutenant, explained shortly.</p>

<p>"A gross case of bullying. Wharton, the head of the
house, is a very good fellow, but slight and weak, and
severe physical pain is the only way to deal with such a
case; so I have asked Holmes to take it up. He is very
careful and trustworthy, and has plenty of strength. I
wish all the sixth had as much. We must have it here, if
we are to keep order at all."</p>

<p>Now, I don't want any wiseacres<a name="FNanchor_38_498" id="FNanchor_38_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_498" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> to read this book; but
if they should, of course they will prick up their long
ears, and howl, or rather bray, at the above story. Very
good, I don't object; but what I have to add for you boys
is this, that Holmes called a levy of his house after breakfast
next morning, made them a speech on the case of
bullying in question, and then gave the bully a "good
sound thrashing"; and that years afterward, that boy
sought out Holmes and thanked him, saying it had been
the kindest act which had ever been done to him, and the
turning-point in his character; and a very good fellow he
became, and a credit to his School.</p>

<p>After some other talk between them, the Doctor said,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
"I want to speak to you about two boys in your form,
East and Brown; I have just been speaking to them.
What do you think of them?"</p>

<p>"Well, they are not hard workers, and very thoughtless
and full of spirits&mdash;but I can't help liking them. I think
they are sound good fellows at the bottom."</p>

<p>"I am glad of it. I think so, too. But they make me
very uneasy. They are taking the lead a good deal
amongst the fags in my house, for they are very active,
bold fellows. I should be sorry to lose them, but I sha'n't
let them stay if I don't see them gaining character and
manliness. In another year they may do great harm to all
the younger boys."</p>

<p>"Oh, I hope you won't send them away," pleaded their
master.</p>

<p>"Not if I can help it. But now I never feel sure, after
any half-holiday, that I sha'n't have to flog one of them
next morning, for some foolish, thoughtless scrape. I
quite dread seeing either of them."</p>

<p>They were both silent for a minute. Presently the
Doctor began again:&mdash;</p>

<p>"They don't feel that they have any duty or work to
do in the School, and how is one to make them feel it?"</p>

<p>"I think if either of them had some little boy to take
care of, it would steady him. Brown is the more reckless
of the two, I should say; East wouldn't get into so many
scrapes without him."</p>

<p>"Well," said the Doctor, with something like a sigh,
"I'll think of it." And they went on to talk of other
subjects.</p>

<p>The turning-point in our hero's school career had now
come, and the manner of it was as follows: On the
evening of the first day of the next half-year, Tom, East,
and another School-house boy, who had just been dropped
at the Spread Eagle by the old Regulator, rushed into the
matron's room in high spirits, such as all real boys are
in when they first get back, however fond they may be
of home.</p>

<p>"Well, Mrs. Wixie," shouted one, seizing on the
methodical, active little dark-eyed woman, who was busy
stowing away the linen of the boys who had already
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
arrived into their several pigeon-holes, "here we are again,
you see, as jolly as ever. Let us help you put the things
away."</p>

<h4>WHO'S COME BACK?</h4>

<p>"And, Mary," cried another (she was called indifferently
by either name), "who's come back? Has the Doctor
made old Jones leave? How many new boys are
there?"</p>

<p>"Am I and East to have Gray's study? You know you
promised to get it for us if you could," shouted Tom.</p>

<p>"And am I to sleep in Number 4?" roared East.</p>

<p>"How's old Sam, and Bogle, and Sally?"</p>

<p>"Bless the boys!" cried Mary, at last getting in a word,
"Why, you'll shake me to death. There, now do go away
up to the housekeeper's room and get your suppers; you
know I haven't time to talk&mdash;you'll find plenty more in
the house. Now, Master East, do let those things alone&mdash;you're
mixing up three new boys' things." And she
rushed at East, who escaped round the open trunks holding
up a prize.</p>

<p>"Hullo, look here, Tommy," shouted he, "here's fun!"
and he brandished above his head some pretty little nightcaps,
beautifully made and marked, the work of loving
fingers in some distant country home. The kind mother
and sisters, who sewed that delicate stitching with aching
hearts, little thought of the trouble they might be bringing
on the young head for which they were meant. The
little matron was wiser, and snatched the caps from East
before he could look at the name on them.</p>

<p>"Now, Master East, I shall be very angry if you don't
go," said she; "there is some capital cold beef and pickles
up stairs, and I won't have you old boys in my room first
night."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>
<p>"Hurrah for the pickles! Come along, Tommy; come
along, Smith. We shall find out who the young count is,
I'll be bound; I hope he'll sleep in my room. Mary's
always vicious first week."</p>

<h4>THE SADDLE IS PUT ON TOM.</h4>

<p>As the boys turned to leave the room, the matron
touched Tom's arm, and said, "Master Brown, please stop
a minute, I want to speak to you."</p>

<p>"Very well, Mary. I'll come in a minute; East, don't
finish the pickles&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Master Brown," went on the little matron, when
the rest had gone, "you're to have Gray's study, Mrs.
Arnold says. And she wants you to take in this young
gentleman. He's a new boy, and thirteen years old,
though he doesn't look it. He's very delicate, and has
never been from home before. And I told Mrs. Arnold I
thought you'd be kind to him, and see that they don't
bully him at first. He's put into your form, and I've
given him the bed next to yours in Number 4; so East
can't sleep there this half."</p>

<p>Tom was rather put about by this speech. He had got
the double study which he coveted, but here were conditions
attached which greatly moderated his joy. He
looked across the room, and in the far corner of the sofa
was aware of a slight pale boy, with large blue eyes and
light fair hair, who seemed ready to shrink through the
floor. He saw at a glance that the little stranger was just
the boy whose first half-year at a public school would be
misery to himself if he were left alone, or constant anxiety
to any one who meant to see him through his troubles.
Tom was too honest to take in the youngster and then
let him shift for himself; and if he took him as his chum
instead of East, where were all his pet plans of making
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
night-lines and slings, and plotting expeditions to Brownsover
Mills and Caldecott's Spinney? East and he had
made up their minds to get this study, and then every
night from locking-up till ten they would be together to
talk about fishing, read Marryat's novels,<a name="FNanchor_1_499" id="FNanchor_1_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_499" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and sort birds'
eggs. And this new boy would most likely never go out
of the close, and would be afraid of wet feet, and always
getting laughed at, and called Molly, or Jenny, or some
derogatory<a name="FNanchor_2_500" id="FNanchor_2_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_500" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> feminine nickname.</p>

<p>The matron watched him for a moment, and saw what
was passing in his mind, and so, like a wise negotiator,
threw in an appeal to his warm heart. "Poor little fellow,"
said she, in almost a whisper, "his father's dead,
and he's got no brothers. And his mamma, such a kind,
sweet lady, almost broke her heart at leaving him this
morning; and she said one of his sisters was like to die of
decline, and so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, well," burst in Tom, with something like a sigh
at the effort. "I suppose I must give up East. Come
along, young un. What's your name? We'll go and
have some supper and then I'll show you our study."</p>

<p>"His name's George Arthur," said the matron, walking
up to him with Tom, who grasped his little delicate hand
as the proper preliminary to making a chum of him, and
felt as if he could have blown him away. "I've had his
books and things put into the study, which his mamma
has had new papered, and the sofa covered, and new
green-baize curtains over the door." (The diplomatic
matron threw this in, to show that the new boy was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
contributing largely to the partnership comforts.) "And
Mrs. Arnold told me to say," she added, "that she should
like you both to come up to tea with her. You know the
way, Master Brown, and the things are just gone up, I
know."</p>

<h4>TEA WITH THE DOCTOR.</h4>

<p>Here was an announcement for Master Tom! He was
to go up to tea the first night, just as if he were a sixth
or fifth form boy, and of importance in the school world,
instead of the most reckless young scapegrace amongst the
fags. He felt himself lifted on to a higher social and
moral platform at once. Nevertheless, he couldn't give
up without a sigh the idea of the jolly supper in the housekeeper's
room with East and the rest, and a rush round to
all the studies of his friends afterward, to pour out the
deeds and wonders of the holidays, to plot fifty plans for
the coming half-year, and to gather news of who had left,
and what new boys had come, who had got who's study,
and where the new pr&aelig;postors slept. However, Tom consoled
himself with thinking that he couldn't have done all
this with the new boy at his heels, and so marched off
along the passages to the Doctor's private house with his
young charge in tow, in monstrous good humor with himself
and all the world.</p>

<p>It is needless, and would be impertinent, to tell how
the two young boys were received in that drawing-room.
The lady who presided there is still living, and has carried
with her to her peaceful home in the North the respect
and love of all those who ever felt and shared that gentle
and high-bred hospitality. Ay, many is the brave heart
now doing its work and bearing its load in country curacies,
London chambers, under the Indian sun, and in
Australian towns and clearings, which looks back with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
fond and grateful memory to that School-house drawing-room,
and dates much of its highest and best training to
the lessons learnt there.</p>

<p>Besides Mrs. Arnold and one or two of the elder children,
there were one of the young masters, young Brooke,
who was now in the sixth, and had succeeded to his
brother's position and influence, and another sixth-form
boy, talking together before the fire. The master and
young Brooke, now a great strapping fellow six feet high,
eighteen years old, and powerful as a coal-heaver, nodded
kindly to Tom, to his intense glory, and then went on
talking; the other did not notice them. The hostess,
after a few kind words, which led the boys at once and
insensibly to feel at their ease, and to begin talking to
one another, left them with her own children while she
finished a letter. The young ones got on fast and well,
Tom holding forth about a prodigious pony he had been
riding out hunting, and hearing stories of the winter
glories of the lakes,<a name="FNanchor_3_501" id="FNanchor_3_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_501" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> when tea came in, and immediately
after the Doctor himself.</p>

<p>How frank, and kind, and manly was his greeting to
the party by the fire! It did Tom's heart good to see him
and young Brooke shake hands and look one another in
the face; and he didn't fail to remark that Brooke was
nearly as tall and quite as broad as the Doctor. And his
cup was full, when in another moment his master turned
to him with another warm shake of the hand, and, seemingly
oblivious of all the late scrapes which he had been
getting into, said: "Ah, Brown, you here! I hope you
left your father and all well at home?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>
<p>"Yes, sir, quite well."</p>

<p>"And this is the little fellow who is to share your
study. Well, he doesn't look as we should like to see
him. He wants some Rugby air, and cricket. And you
must take him some good long walks, to Bilton Grange,
and Caldecott's Spinney, and show him what a pretty
little country we have about here."</p>

<p>Tom wondered if the Doctor knew that his visits to
Bilton Grange were for the purpose of taking rooks' nests
(a proceeding strongly discountenanced by the owner
thereof), and those to Caldecott's Spinney were prompted
chiefly by the conveniences for setting night-lines. What
didn't the Doctor know? And what a noble use he
always made of it! He almost resolved to abjure rookpies
and night-lines forever. The tea went merrily off,
the Doctor now talking of holiday doings, and then of
the prospects of the half-year, what chance there was for
the Balliol scholarship, whether the eleven<a name="FNanchor_4_502" id="FNanchor_4_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_502" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> would be a
good one. Everybody was at his ease, and everybody felt
that he, young as he might be, was of some use in the
little school-world, and had a work to do there.</p>

<p>Soon after tea the Doctor went off to his study, and
the young boys a few minutes afterward took their leave,
and went out of the private door which led from the
Doctor's house into the middle passage.</p>

<h4>ARTHUR'S DEBUT.</h4>

<p>At the fire, at the further end of the passage, was a
crowd of boys in loud talk and laughter. There was a
sudden pause when the door opened, and then a great
shout of greeting as Tom was recognized marching down
the passage.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>
<p>"Hullo, Brown, where do you come from?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I've been to tea with the Doctor," says Tom, with
great dignity.</p>

<p>"My eye!" cried East. "Oh, so that's why Mary
called you back; and you didn't come to supper. You
lost something,&mdash;that beef and pickles was no end good."</p>

<p>"I say, young fellow," cried Hall, detecting Arthur,
and catching him by the collar, "what's your name?
Where do you come from? How old are you?"</p>

<p>Tom saw Arthur shrink back, and look scared as all the
group turned to him, but thought it best to let him
answer, just standing by his side to support in case of
need.</p>

<p>"Arthur, sir. I come from Devonshire."</p>

<p>"Don't call me 'sir,' you young muff. How old are
you?"</p>

<p>"Thirteen."</p>

<p>"Can you sing?"</p>

<p>The poor boy was trembling and hesitating. Tom
struck in&mdash;"You be hanged, Tadpole. He'll have to
sing, whether he can or not, Saturday twelve weeks, and
that's long enough off yet."</p>

<p>"Do you know him at home, Brown?"</p>

<p>"No; but he's my chum in Gray's old study, and it's
near prayer-time, and I haven't had a look at it yet.
Come along, Arthur."</p>

<p>Away went the two, Tom longing to get his charge safe
under cover, where he might advise him on his deportment.</p>

<p>"What a queer chum for Tom Brown," was the comment
at the fire; and it must be confessed so thought Tom
himself, as he lighted his candle, and surveyed the new
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
green-baize curtains and the carpet and sofa with much
satisfaction.</p>

<p>"I say, Arthur, what a brick your mother is to make
us so cozy! But look here now; you must answer straight
up when the fellows speak to you, and don't be afraid.
If you're afraid, you'll get bullied. And don't you say
you can sing; and don't you ever talk about home, or your
mother and sisters."</p>

<p>Poor little Arthur looked ready to cry.</p>

<p>"But please," said he, "mayn't I talk about&mdash;about
home to you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I like it. But don't talk to boys you don't
know, or they'll call you home-sick, or mamma's darling,
or some such stuff. What a jolly desk! is that your's?
And what stunning binding! why, your school-books look
like novels."</p>

<p>And Tom was soon deep in Arthur's goods and chattels,
all new and good enough for a fifth-form boy, and hardly
thought of his friends outside till the prayer-bell rang.</p>

<p>I have already described the School-house prayers; they
were the same on the first night as on the other nights,
save for the gaps caused by the absence of those boys who
came late, and the line of new boys who stood altogether
at the further table,&mdash;of all sorts and sizes, like young
bears with all their trouble to come, as Tom's father had
said to him when he was in the same position. He thought
of it as he looked at the line, and poor little slight Arthur
standing with them, and as he was leading him up-stairs
to Number 4, directly after prayers, and showing him his
bed. It was a huge, high, airy room, with two large windows
looking on to the School close. There were twelve
beds in the room; the one in the furthest corner by the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
fire-place occupied by the sixth-form boy who was responsible
for the discipline of the room, and the rest by
boys in the lower fifth and other junior forms, all fags
(for the fifth-form boys, as has been said, slept in rooms
by themselves). Being fags, the eldest of them was not
more than about sixteen years old, and were all bound to
be up and in bed by ten; the sixth-form boys came to bed
from ten to a quarter-past (at which time the old verger
came round to put the candles out), except when they sat
up to read.</p>

<h4>LESSON NO. 1.</h4>

<p>Within a few minutes, therefore, of their entry, all the
other boys who slept in Number 4 had come up. The
little fellows went quietly to their own beds, and began
undressing and talking to each other in whispers; while
the elder, amongst whom was Tom, sat chatting about on
one another's beds, with their jackets and waistcoats off.
Poor little Arthur was overwhelmed with the novelty of
his position. The idea of sleeping in the room with
strange boys had clearly never crossed his mind before,
and was as painful as it was strange to him. He could
hardly bear to take his jacket off; however, presently,
with an effort, off it came, and then he paused and looked
at Tom, who was sitting at the bottom of his bed talking
and laughing.</p>

<p>"Please, Brown," he whispered, "may I wash my face
and hands?"</p>

<p>"Of course, if you like," said Tom, staring; "that's
your washhand-stand under the window, second from
your bed. You'll have to go down for more water in the
morning if you use it all." And on he went with his talk,
while Arthur stole timidly from between the beds out
to his washhand-stand, and began his ablutions, thereby
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
drawing for a moment on himself the attention of the room.</p>

<p>On went the talk and laughter. Arthur finished his
washing and undressing, and put on his night-gown.
He then looked round more nervously than ever. Two
or three of the little boys were already in bed, sitting up
with their chins on their knees. The light burned clear,
the noise went on. It was a trying moment for the poor
little lonely boy; however, this time he didn't ask Tom
what he might or might not do, but dropped on his knees
by his bedside, as he had done every day from his childhood,
to open his heart to Him who heareth the cry and
beareth the sorrows of the tender child, and the strong
man in agony.</p>

<p>Tom was sitting at the bottom of his bed unlacing his
boots, so that his back was toward Arthur, and he didn't
see what had happened, and looked up in wonder at the
sudden silence. Then two or three boys laughed and
sneered, and a big brutal fellow, who was standing in the
middle of the room, picked up a slipper, and shied it at
the kneeling boy, calling him a snivelling young shaver.
Then Tom saw the whole and the next moment the boot
he had just pulled off flew straight at the head of the
bully, who had just time to throw up his arm and catch
it on his elbow.</p>

<p>"Confound you, Brown, what's that for?" roared he,
stamping with pain.</p>

<p>"Never mind what I mean," said Tom, stepping on to
the floor, every drop of blood in his body tingling; "if
any fellow wants the other boot, he knows how to get it."</p>

<p>What would have been the result is doubtful, for at
this moment the sixth-form boy came in, and not another
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
word could be said. Tom and the rest rushed into bed
and finished their unrobing there, and the old verger, as
punctual as the clock, had put out the candle in another
minute, and toddled on to the next room, shutting their
door with his usual "Goodnight, gen'lm'n."</p>

<p>There were many boys in the room by whom that little
scene was taken to heart before they slept. But sleep
seemed to have deserted the pillow of poor Tom. For
some time his excitement, and the flood of memories which
chased one another through his brain, kept him from thinking
or resolving. His head throbbed, his heart leaped, and
he could hardly keep himself from springing out of bed
and rushing about the room. Then the thought of his
own mother came across him, and the promise he had
made at her knee, years ago, never to forget to kneel by
his bedside, and give himself up to his Father, before he
laid his head on the pillow, from which it might never
rise; and he lay down gently and cried as if his heart
would break. He was only fourteen years old.</p>

<p>It was no light act of courage in those days, my dear
boys, for a little fellow to say his prayers publicly, even at
Rugby. A few years later, when Arnold's manly piety had
begun to leaven the school, the tables turned; before he
died, in the School-house at least, and I believe in the
other house, the rule was the other way. But poor Tom
had come to school in other times. The first few nights
after he came he did not kneel down because of the noise,
but sat up in bed till the candle was out, and then stole
out and said his prayers, in fear lest some one should find
him out. So did many another poor little fellow. Then he
began to think that he might just as well say his prayers
in bed, and then that it didn't matter whether he was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
kneeling, or sitting, or lying down. And so it had come
to pass with Tom, as with all who will not confess their
Lord before men; and for the last year he had probably
not said his prayers in earnest a dozen times.</p>

<p>Poor Tom! the first and bitterest feeling which was like
to break his heart was the sense of his own cowardice.
The vice of all others which he loathed was brought in
and burned in on his own soul. He had lied to his
mother, to his conscience, to his God. How could he
bear it? And then the poor little weak boy, whom he
had pitied and almost scorned for his weakness, had done
that which he, braggart as he was, dared not do. The
first dawn of comfort came to him in swearing to himself
that he would stand by that boy through thick and thin,
and cheer him, and help him, and bear his burdens, for the
good deed done that night. Then he resolved to write
home next day and tell his mother all, and what a coward
her son had been. And then peace came to him as he
resolved, lastly, to bear his testimony next morning. The
morning would be harder than the night to begin with, but
he felt that he could not afford to let one chance slip. Several
times he faltered, for the devil showed him first all his
old friends calling him "Saint" and "Square-toes," and a
dozen hard names, and whispered to him that his motives
would be misunderstood, and he would only be left alone
with the new boy; whereas it was his duty to keep all
means of influence, that he might do good to the largest
number. And then came the more subtle temptation,
"Shall I not be showing myself braver than others by
doing this? Have I any right to begin it now? Ought I
not rather to pray in my own study, letting other boys
know that I do so, and trying to lead them to do it, while
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
in public at least I should go on as I have done?" However,
his good angel was too strong that night, and he
turned on his side and slept, tired of trying to reason, but
resolved to follow the impulse which had been so strong,
and in which he had found peace.</p>

<h4>TOM LEARNS HIS LESSON.</h4>

<p>Next morning he was up and washed and dressed, all
but his jacket and waistcoat, just as the ten minutes' bell
began to ring, and then in the face of the whole room
knelt down to pray. Not five words could he say&mdash;the
bell mocked him; he was listening for every whisper in
the room&mdash;what were they all thinking of him? He was
ashamed to go on kneeling, ashamed to rise from his
knees. At last, as it were from his inmost heart, a still
small voice seemed to breathe forth the words of the
publican,<a name="FNanchor_5_503" id="FNanchor_5_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_503" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> "God be merciful to me a sinner!" He repeated
them over and over, clinging to them as for his life, and
rose from his knees comforted and humbled, and ready to
face the whole world. It was not needed; two other boys
besides Arthur had already followed his example, and he
went down to the Great School with a glimmering of
another lesson in his heart,&mdash;the lesson that he who has
conquered his own coward spirit has conquered the whole
outward world; and that other one which the old prophet
learnt in the cave in Mount Horeb, when he hid his face,
and the still small voice asked: "What doest thou here,
Elijah?"<a name="FNanchor_6_504" id="FNanchor_6_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_504" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> that however we may fancy ourselves alone on
the side of good, the King and Lord of men is nowhere
without his witnesses; for in every society, however seemingly
corrupt and godless, there are those who have not
bowed the knee to Baal.<a name="FNanchor_7_505" id="FNanchor_7_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_505" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>
<p>He found, too, how greatly he had exaggerated the
effect to be produced by his act. For a few nights there
was a sneer or a laugh when he knelt down, but this
passed off soon, and one by one all the other boys but three
or four followed the lead. I fear that this was in some
measure due to the fact that Tom could probably have
thrashed any boy in the room except the pr&aelig;postor; at
any rate, every boy knew that he would try upon very
slight provocation, and didn't choose to run the risk of a
hard fight because Tom Brown had taken a fancy to say
his prayers. Some of the small boys of Number 4 communicated
the new state of things to their chums, and in
several other rooms the poor little fellows tried it on; in
one instance or so, where the pr&aelig;postor heard of it and
interfered very decidedly, with partial success; but in the
rest, after a short struggle, the confessors were bullied or
laughed down, and the old state of things went on for
some time longer. Before either Tom Brown or Arthur
left the School-house, there was no room in which it had
not become the regular custom. I trust it is so still, and
that the old heathen state of things has gone out forever.</p>

<h4>TOM'S RESPONSIBILITIES.</h4>

<p>I do not mean to recount all the little troubles and annoyances
which thronged upon Tom at the beginning
of this half-year, in his new character of bear-leader to a
gentle little boy straight from home. He seemed to himself
to have become a new boy again, without any of the
long-suffering and meekness indispensable for supporting
that character with moderate success. From morning till
night he had the feeling of responsibility on his mind;
and, even if he left Arthur in their study or in the close
for an hour, was never at ease till he had him in sight
again. He waited for him at the doors of the school after
every lesson and every calling-over; watched that no
tricks were played him and none but the regulation questions
asked; kept his eye on his plate at dinner and
breakfast, to see that no unfair depredations were made
upon his viands; in short, as East remarked, cackled after
him like a hen with one chick.</p>

<p>Arthur took a long time thawing, too, which made it
all the harder work; was sadly timid; scarcely ever spoke
unless Tom spoke to him first; and, worst of all, would
agree with him in everything, the hardest thing in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
world for a Brown to bear. He got quite angry sometimes,
as they sat together of a night in their study, at
this provoking habit of agreement, and was on the point
of breaking out a dozen times with a lecture upon the
propriety of a fellow having a will of his own and speaking
out, but managed to restrain himself by the thought that
he might only frighten Arthur, and the remembrance of
the lesson he had learnt from him on his first night at
Number 4. Then he would resolve to sit still, and not
say a word till Arthur began; but he was always beat at
that game, and had presently to begin talking in despair,
fearing lest Arthur might think he was vexed at something
if he didn't, and dog-tired of sitting tongue-tied.</p>

<p>It was hard work! But Tom had taken it up, and meant
to stick to it, and go through with it, so as to satisfy himself;
in which resolution he was much assisted by the chaffing
of East and his other friends, who began to call him
"dry-nurse," and otherwise to break their small wit on
him. But when they took other ground, as they did every
now and then, Tom was sorely puzzled.</p>

<h4>EAST'S ADVICE.</h4>

<p>"Tell you what, Tommy," East would say, "you'll
spoil young Hopeful with too much coddling. Why can't
you let him go about by himself, and find his own level?
He'll never be worth a button, if you go on keeping him
under your skirts."</p>

<p>"Well, but he isn't fit to fight his own way yet; I'm
trying to get him to do it every day&mdash;but he's very odd.
Poor little beggar! I can't make him out a bit. He isn't
a bit like anything I've ever seen or heard of&mdash;he seems
all over nerves; anything you say seems to hurt him like
a cut or a blow."</p>

<p>"That sort of boy's no use here," said East; "he'll only
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
spoil. Now, I'll tell you what to do, Tommy. Go and
get a nice large band-box made, and put him in with
plenty of cotton-wool, and a pap-bottle,<a name="FNanchor_1_506" id="FNanchor_1_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_506" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> labelled 'with
care&mdash;this side up,' and send him back to mamma."</p>

<p>"I think I shall make a hand of him, though," said
Tom, smiling, "say what you will. There's something
about him, every now and then, which shows me he's got
pluck somewhere in him. That's the only thing, after all,
that'll wash,<a name="FNanchor_2_507" id="FNanchor_2_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_507" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> isn't it, old Scud? But how to get at it and
bring it out?"</p>

<p>Tom took one hand out of his breeches' pocket and
stuck it in his back hair for a scratch, giving his hat a tilt
over his nose, his one method of invoking wisdom. He
stared at the ground with a ludicrously puzzled look, and
presently looked up and met East's eyes. That young
gentleman slapped him on the back, and then put his arm
around his shoulders, as they strolled through the quadrangle
together. "Tom," said he, "blest if you aren't
the best old fellow ever was&mdash;I do like to see you go into
a thing. Hang it, I wish I could take things as you do,
but I never can get higher than a joke. Everything's a
joke. If I was going to be flogged next minute, I should
be in a blue funk,<a name="FNanchor_3_508" id="FNanchor_3_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_508" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> but I couldn't help laughing at it for
the life of me."</p>

<p>"Brown and East, you go and fag for Jones on the
great fives'-court."</p>

<p>"Hullo, though, that's past a joke," broke out East,
springing at the young gentleman who addressed them,
and catching him by the collar. "Here, Tommy, catch
hold of him t'other side before he can holla."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>
<h4>AN EPISODE.</h4>

<p>The youth was seized, and dragged struggling out of
the quadrangle into the School-house hall. He was one
of the miserable little pretty, white-handed, curly-headed
boys, petted and pampered by some of the big fellows,
who wrote their verses for them, taught them to drink,
and use bad language, and did all they could to spoil them
for everything in this world and the next. One of the
avocations in which these young gentlemen took particular
delight was in going about and getting fags for their protectors,
when those heroes were playing any game. They
carried about pencil and paper with them, putting down
the names of all the boys they sent, always sending five
times as many as were wanted, and getting all those
thrashed who didn't go. The present youth belonged to
a house which was very jealous of the School-house, and
always picked out School-house fags when he could find
them. However, this time he'd got the wrong pig by the
ear. His captors slammed the great door of the hall, and
East put his back against it, while Tom gave the prisoner
a shake-up, took away his list, and stood him up on the
floor, while he proceeded leisurely to examine that document.</p>

<p>"Let me out! let me go!" screamed the boy in a furious
passion. "I'll go and tell Jones this minute, and he'll
give you both the biggest thrashing you ever had."</p>

<p>"Pretty little dear," said East, patting the top of his
hat; "listen to him, Tom. Nicely brought-up young
man, isn't he, though?"</p>

<p>"Let me alone&mdash;&mdash;you," roared the boy, foaming with
rage, and kicking at East, who quietly tripped him up,
and deposited him on the floor in a place of safety.</p>

<p>"Gently, young fellow," said he, "'tisn't improving
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
for little whippersnappers like you to be indulging in
such language; so you stop that, or you'll get something
you won't like."</p>

<p>"I'll have you both licked when I get out, that I will,"
rejoined the boy, beginning to snivel.</p>

<p>"Two can play at that game, mind you," said Tom,
who had finished his examination of the list. "Now you
just listen here. We've just come across the fives'-court,
and Jones has four fags there already, two more than he
wants. If he'd wanted us to change, he'd have stopped
us himself. And here, you little blackguard, you've got
seven names down on your list besides ours, and five of
them School-house." Tom walked up to him and jerked
him on to his legs; he was by this time whining like a
whipped puppy.</p>

<p>"Now just listen to me. We aren't going to fag for
Jones. If you tell him you've sent us, we'll each of us
give you such a thrashing as you'll remember." And Tom
tore up the list and threw the pieces into the fire.</p>

<p>"And mind you, too," said East, "don't let me catch
you again sneaking about the School-house, and picking
up our fags. You haven't got the sort of hide to take a
sound licking kindly;" and he opened the door and sent
the young gentleman flying into the quadrangle, with a
parting kick.</p>

<p>"Nice boy, Tommy," said East, shoving his hands into
his pockets and strolling to the fire.</p>

<p>"Worst sort we breed," responded Tom, following his
example. "Thank goodness no big fellow ever took to
petting me."</p>

<p>"You'd never have been like that," said East. "I
should like to have put him in a museum: Christian young
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
gentleman, nineteenth century, highly educated. Stir
him up with a long pole, Jack, and hear him swear like a
drunken sailor! He'd make a respectable public open its
eyes, I think."</p>

<p>"Think he'll tell Jones?" said Tom.</p>

<p>"No," said East. "Don't care if he does."</p>

<p>"Nor I," said Tom; and they went back to talk about
Arthur.</p>

<p>The young gentleman had brains enough not to tell
Jones, reasoning that East and Brown, who were noted as
some of the toughest fags in the school, wouldn't care
three straws for any licking Jones might give them, and
would be likely to keep their words as to passing it on
with interest.</p>

<h4>LESSON NO. 2.</h4>

<p>After the above conversation, East came a good deal to
their study, and took notice of Arthur; and soon allowed
to Tom that he was a thorough little gentleman, and
would get over his shyness all in good time; which much
comforted our hero. He felt every day, too, the value of
having an object in his life, something that drew him out
of himself; and, it being the dull time of the year, and no
games going about which he much cared, was happier
than he had ever yet been at school, which was saying
a great deal.</p>

<p>The time which Tom allowed himself away from his
charge was from locking-up till supper-time. During this
hour or hour and a half he used to take his fling, going
round to the studies of all his acquaintance, sparring or
gossiping in the hall, now jumping the old iron-bound
tables, or carving a bit of his name on them, then joining
in some chorus of merry voices; in fact, blowing off his
steam, as we should now call it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>
<p>This process was so congenial<a name="FNanchor_4_509" id="FNanchor_4_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_509" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> to his temper, and Arthur
showed himself so pleased at the arrangement, that it was
several weeks before Tom was ever in their study before
supper. One evening, however, he rushed in to look for
an old chisel, or some corks, or other article essential to
his pursuit for the time being, and, while rummaging about
in the cupboards, looked up for a moment, and was caught
at once by the figure of poor little Arthur. The boy was
sitting with his elbows on the table, and his head leaning
on his hands, and before him an open book, on which his
tears were falling fast. Tom shut the door at once, and
sat down on the sofa by Arthur, putting his arm round
his neck.</p>

<p>"Why, young un! what's the matter?" said he, kindly.
"You aren't unhappy, are you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Brown," said the little boy, looking up with
great tears in his eyes; "you are so kind to me, I'm very
happy."</p>

<p>"Why don't you call me Tom? lots of boys do that I
don't like half so much as I do you. What are you reading,
then? Hang it, you must come about with me, and
not mope yourself," and Tom cast down his eyes on the
book, and saw it was the Bible. He was silent for a
minute, and thought to himself, "Lesson Number 2, Tom
Brown;" and said, gently:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'm very glad to see this, Arthur, and ashamed that
I don't read the Bible more myself. Do you read it every
night before supper, while I'm out?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, I wish you'd wait till afterward, and then we'd
read together. But, Arthur, why does it make you cry?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>
<p>"Oh, it isn't that I'm unhappy. But at home, while my
father was alive, we always read the lessons<a name="FNanchor_5_510" id="FNanchor_5_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_510" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> after tea; and
I love to read them over now, and try to remember what
he said about them. I can't remember all, and I think I
scarcely understand a great deal of what I do remember.
But it all comes back to me so fresh that I can't help crying
sometimes to think that I shall never read them again
with him."</p>

<h4>ARTHUR'S HOME.</h4>

<p>Arthur had never spoken of his home before, and Tom
hadn't encouraged him to do so, as his blundering schoolboy
reasoning made him think that Arthur would be
softened and less manly for thinking of home. But now
he was fairly interested, and forgot all about chisels and
bottled beer; while with very little encouragement Arthur
launched into his home history, and the prayer-bell put
them both out sadly when it rang to call them to the hall.</p>

<p>From this time Arthur constantly spoke of his home,
and, above all, of his father, who had been dead about a
year, and whose memory Tom soon got to love and reverence
almost as much as his own son did.</p>

<p>Arthur's father had been the clergyman of a parish in
the Midland Counties,<a name="FNanchor_6_511" id="FNanchor_6_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_511" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> which had risen into a large town
during the war,<a name="FNanchor_7_512" id="FNanchor_7_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_512" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and upon which the hard years which
followed had fallen with fearful weight. The trade had
been half ruined; and then came the old sad story of masters
reducing their establishments, men turned off, and
wandering about, hungry and wan in body, and fierce in
soul, from the thought of wives and children starving at
home, and the last sticks of furniture going to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
pawnshop: children taken from school, and lounging about the
dirty streets and courts,<a name="FNanchor_8_513" id="FNanchor_8_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_513" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> too listless almost to play, and
squalid in rags and misery. And then the fearful struggle
between the employers and men; lowerings of wages,
strikes, and the long course of oft-repeated crime, ending
every now and then with a riot, a fire, and the county
yeomanry.<a name="FNanchor_9_514" id="FNanchor_9_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_514" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> There is no need here to dwell upon such
tales; the Englishman into whose soul they have not sunk
deep is not worthy the name; you English boys for whom
this book is meant (God bless your bright faces and kind
hearts!) will learn it all soon enough.</p>

<p>Into such a parish and state of society Arthur's father
had been thrown at the age of twenty-five, a young
married parson, full of faith, hope and love. He had
battled with it like a man, and had lots of fine Utopian<a name="FNanchor_10_515" id="FNanchor_10_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_515" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
ideas about the perfectibility of mankind, glorious humanity
and such-like knocked out of his head: and a real
wholesome Christian love for the poor, struggling, sinning
men, of whom he felt himself one, and with and for whom
he spent fortune, and strength and life, driven into his
heart. He had battled like a man, and gotten a man's
reward. No silver teapots or salvers,<a name="FNanchor_11_516" id="FNanchor_11_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_516" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> with flowery inscriptions,
setting forth his virtues and the appreciation of
a genteel parish; no fat living or stall,<a name="FNanchor_12_517" id="FNanchor_12_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_517" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> for which he never
looked, and didn't care; no sighs and praises of comfortable
dowagers<a name="FNanchor_13_518" id="FNanchor_13_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_518" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and well got-up young women who
worked him slippers, sugared his tea, and adored him as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
"a devoted man"; but a manly respect, wrung from the
unwilling souls of men who fancied his order their natural
enemies; the fear and hatred of every one who was false
or unjust in the district, were he master or man; and the
blessed sight of women and children daily becoming more
human and more homely,<a name="FNanchor_14_519" id="FNanchor_14_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_519" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> a comfort to themselves and to
their husbands and fathers.</p>

<p>These things of course took time, and had to be fought
for with toil and sweat of brain and heart, and with the
life-blood poured out. All that, Arthur<a name="FNanchor_15_520" id="FNanchor_15_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_520" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> had laid his account
to give, and took as a matter of course; neither
pitying himself, nor looking on himself as a martyr, when
he felt the wear and tear making him feel old before his
time, and the stifling air of fever-dens telling on his
health. His wife seconded him in everything. She had
been rather fond of society, and much admired and run
after before her marriage; and the London world to which
she had belonged pitied poor Fanny Evelyn when she
married the young clergyman, and went to settle in that
smoky hole, Turley, a very nest of Chartism<a name="FNanchor_16_521" id="FNanchor_16_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_521" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and Atheism,
in a part of the country which all the decent families had
had to leave for years. However, somehow or other she
didn't seem to care. If her husband's living<a name="FNanchor_17_522" id="FNanchor_17_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_522" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> had been
amongst green fields and near pleasant neighbors, she
would have liked it better,&mdash;that she never pretended to
deny. But there they were; the air wasn't bad, after all;
the people were very good sort of people,&mdash;civil to you if
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
you were civil to them, after the first brush; and they
didn't expect to work miracles, and convert them all off-hand
into model Christians. So he and she went quietly
among the folk, talking to and treating them just as they
would have done people of their own rank. They didn't
feel that they were doing anything out of the common
way, and so were perfectly natural and had none of that
condescension or consciousness of manner which so out-rages
the independent poor. And thus they gradually
won respect and confidence; and after sixteen years he
was looked up to by the whole neighborhood as <i>the</i> just
man, <i>the</i> man to whom masters and men could go in
their strikes, and in all their quarrels and difficulties,
and by whom the right and true word would be said
without fear or favor. And the women had come round
to take her advice, and go to her as a friend in all their
troubles, while all the children worshipped the ground she
trod on.</p>

<p>They had three children, two daughters and a son, little
Arthur, who came between his sisters. He had been a
very delicate boy from his childhood; they thought he
had a tendency to consumption, and so he had been kept
at home and taught by his father, who had made a companion
of him, and from whom he had gained good scholarship,
and a knowledge of, and an interest in, many subjects
which boys in general never come across till they are
many years older.</p>

<p>Just as he reached his thirteenth year, and his father
had settled that he was strong enough to go to school;
and, after much debating with himself, had resolved to
send him there, a desperate fever broke out in the town;
most of the other clergy, and almost all the doctors, ran
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
away; the work fell with tenfold weight on those who
stood to their work. Arthur and his wife both caught the
fever, of which he died in a few days, and she recovered,
having been able to nurse him to the end, and store up his
last words. He was sensible to the last, and calm and
happy, leaving his wife and children with fearless trust
for a few years in the hands of the Lord and Friend who
had lived and died for him, and for whom he, to the best
of his power, had lived and died. His widow's mourning
was deep and gentle; she was more affected by the request
of the Committee of a Free-thinking club, established in
the town by some of the factory hands (which he had striven
against with might and main, and nearly suppressed), that
some of their number might be allowed to help bear the
coffin, than by anything else. Two of them were chosen,
who with six laboring men, his own fellow-workmen and
friends, bore him to his grave,&mdash;a man who had fought the
Lord's fight even unto the death. The shops were closed
and the factories shut that day in the parish, yet no master
stopped the day's wages; but for many a year afterward
the towns-folk felt the want of that brave, hopeful, loving
parson, and his wife, who had lived to teach them mutual
forbearance and helpfulness, and had <i>almost</i> at last given
them a glimpse of what this old world would be, if people
would live for God and each other, instead of for themselves.</p>

<p>What has all this to do with our story? Well, my dear
boys, let a fellow go on in his own way, or you won't get
anything out of him worth having. I must show you what
sort of a man it was who had brought up little Arthur, or
else you won't believe in him, which I am resolved you
shall do; and you won't see how he, the timid, weak boy,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
had points in him from which the bravest and strongest
recoiled, and made his presence and example felt from the
first on all sides, unconsciously to himself, and without the
least attempt at proselytizing.<a name="FNanchor_18_523" id="FNanchor_18_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_523" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> The spirit of his father
was in him, and the Friend to which his father had left
him did not neglect the trust.</p>

<h4>RESULTS OF LESSON NO. 2.</h4>

<p>After supper that night, and almost nightly for years
afterwards, Tom and Arthur, and by degrees East occasionally,
and sometimes one, sometimes another of their
friends, read a chapter of the Bible together, and talked it
over afterwards. Tom was at first utterly astonished, and
almost shocked, at the sort of way in which Arthur read
the book, and talked about the men and women whose
lives were there told. The first night they happened to
fall on the chapters about the famine in Egypt,<a name="FNanchor_19_524" id="FNanchor_19_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_524" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and
Arthur began talking about Joseph<a name="FNanchor_20_525" id="FNanchor_20_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_525" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> as if he were a living
statesman; just as he might have talked about Lord Grey
and the Reform Bill;<a name="FNanchor_21_526" id="FNanchor_21_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_526" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> only that they were much more
living realities to him. The book was to him, Tom saw,
the most vivid and delightful history of real people, who
might do right or wrong, just like any one who was
walking about in Rugby,&mdash;the Doctor, or the masters, or
the sixth-form boys. But the astonishment soon passed
off, the scales seemed to drop from his eyes, and the book
became at once and forever to him the great human and
divine book, and the men and women, whom he had
looked upon as something quite different from himself,
became his friends and counsellors.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>
<h4>TOM IS STIFF-NECKED.</h4>

<p>For our purposes, however, the history of one night's
reading will be sufficient, which must be told here, now
we are on the subject, though it didn't happen till a year
afterwards, and long after the events recorded in the next
chapter of our story.</p>

<p>Arthur, Tom, and East were together one night, and
read the story of Naaman coming to Elisha to be cured of
his leprosy.<a name="FNanchor_22_527" id="FNanchor_22_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_527" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> When the chapter was finished, Tom shut
his Bible with a slap.</p>

<p>"I can't stand that fellow Naaman," said he, "after
what he'd seen and felt, going back and bowing himself
down in the house of Rimmon, because his effeminate
scoundrel of a master did it. I wonder Elisha took the
trouble to heal him. How he must have despised him!"</p>

<p>"Yes, there you go off as usual; with a shell on your
head," struck in East, who always took the opposite side
to Tom; half from love of argument, half from conviction.
"How do you know he didn't think better of it?
how do you know his master was a scoundrel? His letter
doesn't look like it, and the book doesn't say so."</p>

<p>"I don't care," rejoined Tom; "why did Naaman talk
about bowing down, then, if he didn't mean to do it? He
wasn't likely to get more in earnest when he got back to
court and away from the prophet."</p>

<p>"Well, but Tom," said Arthur, "look what Elisha says
to him: 'Go in peace.' He wouldn't have said that if
Naaman had been in the wrong."</p>

<p>"I don't see that that means more than saying: 'You're
not the man I took you for.'"</p>

<p>"No, no, that won't do at all," said East; "read the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
words fairly, and take men as you find them. I like
Naaman, and think he was a very fine fellow."</p>

<p>"I don't," said Tom, positively.</p>

<p>"Well I think East is right," said Arthur; "I can't
see but what it's right to do the best you can, though it
mayn't be the best absolutely. Every man isn't born to
be a martyr."</p>

<p>"Of course, of course," said East; "but he's on one of
his pet hobbies. How often have I told you, Tom, that
you must drive a nail where it'll go."</p>

<p>"And how often have I told you," rejoined Tom, "that
it'll always go where you want, if you only stick to it and
hit hard enough. I hate half measures and compromises."</p>

<p>"Yes, he's a whole hog man, is Tom. Must have the
whole animal, hair and teeth, claws and tail," laughed
East. "Sooner have no bread, any day, than half the
loaf."</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Arthur; "it's rather puzzling;
but aren't most right things got by proper compromises?
I mean where the principle isn't given up."</p>

<h4>THE BROWN COMPROMISE.</h4>

<p>"That's just the point," said Tom; "I don't object to
a compromise where you don't give up your principle."</p>

<p>"Not you," said East, laughingly. "I know him of
old, Arthur, and you'll find him out some day. There
isn't such a reasonable fellow in the world, to hear him
talk. He never wants anything but what's right and fair;
only when you come to settle what's right and fair, it's
everything that he wants, and nothing that you want.
And that's his idea of a compromise. Give me the Brown
compromise when I'm on his side."</p>

<p>"Now, Harry," said Tom, "no more chaff&mdash;I'm serious.
Look here&mdash;this is what makes my blood tingle;"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
and he turned over the pages of his Bible and read:
"Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered and said
to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar,<a name="FNanchor_23_528" id="FNanchor_23_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_528" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> we are not careful to
answer thee in this matter. If it <i>be</i> so, our God whom we
serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace,
and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king. But <i>if
not</i>, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will <i>not</i> serve
thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast
set up." He read the last verse twice, emphasizing the
<i>nots</i>, and dwelling on them as if they gave him actual
pleasure, and were hard to part with.</p>

<p>They were silent a minute, and then Arthur said: "Yes,
that's a glorious story, but it doesn't prove your point,
Tom, I think. There are times when there is only one
way, and that the highest; and then the men are found to
stand in the breach."</p>

<p>"There's always a highest way, and it's always the
right one," said Tom. "How many times has the Doctor
told us that in his sermons in the last year, I should like
to know?"</p>

<p>"Well, you aren't going to convince us, is he, Arthur?
No Brown compromise to-night," said East, looking at
his watch. "But it's past eight, and we must go to first
lesson. What a bore!"</p>

<p>So they took down their books and fell to work; but
Arthur didn't forget, and thought long and often over
the conversation.</p>

<h4>TROUBLES OF A BOY-PHILOSOPHER.</h4>

<p>About six weeks after the beginning of the half, as
Tom and Arthur were sitting one night before
supper beginning their verses, Arthur suddenly stopped,
and looked up, and said: "Tom, do you know anything
of Martin?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Tom, taking his hand out of his back hair,
and delighted to throw his Gradus ad Parnassum<a name="FNanchor_1_529" id="FNanchor_1_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_529" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> on to
the sofa; "I know him pretty well. He's a very good
fellow, but as mad as a hatter. He's called Madman, you
know. And never was such a fellow for getting all sorts
of rum<a name="FNanchor_2_530" id="FNanchor_2_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_530" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> things about him. He tamed two snakes last half,
and used to carry them about in his pocket, and I'll be
bound he's got some hedge-hogs and rats in his cupboard
now, and no one knows what besides."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>
<p>"I should like very much to know him," said Arthur;
"he was next to me in the form to-day, and he'd lost his
book and looked over mine, and he seemed so kind and
gentle that I liked him very much."</p>

<p>"Ah, poor old Madman, he's always losing his books,"
said Tom, "and getting called up and floored because he
hasn't got them."</p>

<p>"I like him all the better," said Arthur.</p>

<p>"Well, he's great fun, I can tell you," said Tom, throwing
himself back on the sofa, and chuckling at the remembrance.
"We had such a game with him one day
last half. He had been trying chemical experiments and
kicking up horrid stenches for some time in his study, till
I suppose some fellow told Mary, and she told the Doctor.
Anyhow, one day, a little before dinner, when he came
down from the library, the Doctor, instead of going home,
came striding into the Hall. East and I and five or six
other fellows were at the fire, and preciously we stared,
for he doesn't come in like that once a year, unless it is a
wet day and there's a fight in the Hall. 'East,' says he,
'just come and show me Martin's study.' 'Oh, here's a
game,' whispered the rest of us, and we all cut up-stairs
after the Doctor, East leading. As we got into the New
Row, which was hardly wide enough to hold the Doctor
and his gown, click, click, click, we heard in the old Madman's
den. Then that stopped all of a sudden, and the
bolts went to like fun; the Madman knew East's step,
and thought there was going to be a siege.</p>

<p>"'It's the Doctor, Martin. He's here, and wants to see
you,' sings out East.</p>

<p>"Then the bolts went back slowly, and the door
opened, and there was the old Madman standing, looking
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
precious scared; his jacket off, his shirt-sleeves up to his
elbows, and his long skinny arms all covered with anchors,
and arrows, and letters, tattooed in with gunpowder like a
sailor-boy's, and a stench fit to knock you down coming
out. 'Twas all the Doctor could do to stand his ground,
and East and I, who were looking in under his arms, held
our noses tight. The old magpie was standing on the
window-sill, all his feathers drooping, and looking disgusted
and half-poisoned.</p>

<p>"'What can you be about, Martin?' says the Doctor;
'you really musn't go on in this way&mdash;you're a nuisance
to the whole passage.'</p>

<p>"'Please, sir, I was only mixing up this powder; there
isn't any harm in it;' and the Madman seized nervously
on his pestle and mortar, to show the Doctor the harmlessness
of his pursuits, and went on pounding; click,
click, click. He hadn't given six clicks before, puff! up
went the whole into a great blaze, away went the pestle
and mortar across the study, and back we tumbled into
the passage. The magpie<a name="FNanchor_3_531" id="FNanchor_3_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_531" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> fluttered down into the court,
swearing, and the Madman danced out, howling, with his
fingers in his mouth. The Doctor caught hold of him,
and called to us to fetch some water. 'There, you silly
fellow,' said he, quite pleased, though, to find he wasn't
much hurt, 'you see you don't know the least what you
are doing with all these things; and now, mind, you must
give up practising chemistry by yourself.' Then he took
hold of his arm and looked at it, and I saw he had to bite
his lip, and his eyes twinkled; but he said, quite gravely,
'Here, you see, you've been making all these foolish
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
marks on yourself, which you can never get out, and
you'll be very sorry for it in a year or two. Now come
down into the housekeeper's room, and let us see if you
are hurt.' And away went the two, and we all stayed
and had a regular turn-out of the den, till Martin came
back with his hand bandaged and turned us out. However,
I'll go and see what he's after, and tell him to
come in after prayers to supper." And away went Tom
to find the boy in question, who dwelt in a little study by
himself in New Row.</p>

<p>The aforesaid Martin whom Arthur had taken such a
fancy for was one of those unfortunates who were at that
time of day (and are, I fear, still) quite out of their
places at a public school. If we knew how to use our
boys, Martin would have been seized upon and educated
as a natural philosopher. He had a passion for birds,
beasts, and insects, and knew more of them and their
habits than any one in Rugby, except perhaps the Doctor,
who knew everything. He was also an experimental
chemist on a small scale, and had made unto himself an
electric machine, from which it was his greatest pleasure
and glory to administer small shocks to any small boys
who were rash enough to venture into his study. And
this was by no means an adventure free from excitement;
for, besides the probability of a snake dropping on to
your head, or twining lovingly up your leg, or a rat
getting into your breeches' pocket in search of food,
there was the animal and chemical odor to be faced,
which always hung about the den, and the chance of
being blown up in some of the many experiments which
Martin was always trying, with the most wonderful results
in the shape of explosions and smells that mortal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
boy ever heard of. Of course, poor Martin, in consequence
of his pursuits, had become an Ishmaelite in the
house. In the first place, he half poisoned all his neighbors,
and they in turn were always on the look-out to
pounce upon any of his numerous live stock and drive
him frantic by enticing his pet old magpie out of his
window into a neighboring study, and making the disreputable
old bird drunk on toast soaked in beer and sugar.
Then Martin, for his sins, inhabited a study looking into a
small court some ten feet across, the window of which
was completely commanded by those of the studies opposite
in the sick-room row, these latter being at a slightly
higher elevation. East and another boy of an equally
tormenting and ingenious turn of mind, now lived exactly
opposite, and had expended huge pains and time in the
preparation of instruments of annoyance for the behoof
of Martin and his live colony. One morning an old
basket made its appearance, suspended by a short cord,
outside Martin's window, in which were deposited an
amateur nest<a name="FNanchor_4_532" id="FNanchor_4_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_532" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> containing four young, hungry jackdaws,
the pride and glory of Martin's life for the time being,
and which he was currently asserted to have hatched
upon his own person. Early in the morning and late at
night he was to be seen half out of window, administering
to the varied wants of his callow<a name="FNanchor_5_533" id="FNanchor_5_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_533" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> brood. After deep
cogitation,<a name="FNanchor_6_534" id="FNanchor_6_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_534" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> East and his chum had spliced a knife on to
the end of a fishing rod; and having watched Martin out,
had, after half an hour's severe sawing, cut the string by
which the basket was suspended, and tumbled it on to
the pavement below, with hideous remonstrance from the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
occupants. Poor Martin, returning from his short absence,
collected the fragments and replaced his brood
(except one whose neck had been broken in the descent)
in their old location, suspending them this time by string
and wire twisted together, defiant of any sharp instrument
which his persecutors could command. But, like
the Russian engineers at Sebastopol,<a name="FNanchor_7_535" id="FNanchor_7_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_535" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> East and his chum
had an answer for every move of the adversary; and
the next day had mounted a gun in the shape of a pea-shooter
upon the ledge of their window, trained so as to
bear exactly upon the spot which Martin had to occupy
while tending his nurslings. The moment he began to
feed, they began to shoot; in vain did the enemy himself
invest in a pea-shooter, and endeavor to answer the fire
while he fed the young birds with his other hand; his
attention was divided, and his shots flew wild, while every
one of theirs told on his face and hands, and drove him
into howlings and imprecations. He had been driven to ensconce<a name="FNanchor_8_536" id="FNanchor_8_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_536" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
the nest in a corner of his already too well-filled den.</p>

<h4>THE PHILOSOPHER'S DEN.</h4>

<p>The door was barricaded by a set of ingenious bolts of
his own invention, for the sieges were frequent by the
neighbors when any unusually ambrosial<a name="FNanchor_9_537" id="FNanchor_9_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_537" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> odor spread itself
from the den to the neighboring studies. The door-panels
were in a normal<a name="FNanchor_10_538" id="FNanchor_10_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_538" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> state of smash, but the frame of the
door resisted all besiegers, and behind it the owner
carried on his varied pursuits; much in the same state of
mind, I should fancy, as a border-farmer<a name="FNanchor_11_539" id="FNanchor_11_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_539" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> lived in, in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
days of the old moss-troopers,<a name="FNanchor_12_540" id="FNanchor_12_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_540" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> when his hold might be
summoned or his cattle carried off at any minute of night
or day.</p>

<p>"Open, Martin, old boy&mdash;it's only I, Tom Brown."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well, stop a moment." One bolt went back.
"You're sure East isn't there?"</p>

<p>"No, no, hang it, open." Tom gave a kick, the other
bolt creaked, and he entered the den.</p>

<p>Den indeed it was, about five feet six inches long by
five wide, and seven feet high. About six tattered schoolbooks,
and a few chemical books, taxidermy,<a name="FNanchor_13_541" id="FNanchor_13_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_541" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Stanley on
Birds, and an odd volume of Bewick,<a name="FNanchor_14_542" id="FNanchor_14_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_542" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> the latter in much
better preservation, occupied the top shelves. The other
shelves, where they had not been cut away and used by
the owner for other purposes, were fitted up for the
abiding-places of birds, beasts and reptiles. There was
no attempt at carpet or curtain. The table was entirely
occupied by the great work of Martin, the electric machine,
which was covered carefully with the remains of
his table-cloths. The jackdaw cage occupied one wall,
and the other was adorned by a small hatchet, a pair of
climbing-irons, and his tin candle-box, in which he was
for the time being endeavoring to raise a hopeful young
family of field-mice. As nothing should be let to lie useless,
it was well that the candle-box was thus occupied,
for candles Martin never had. A pound was issued to
him weekly as to the other boys, but as candles were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
available capital, and easily exchangeable for birds' eggs
or young birds, Martin's pound invariably found its way
in a few hours to Howlett, the bird-fancier's,<a name="FNanchor_15_543" id="FNanchor_15_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_543" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> in the Bilton
road, who could give a hawk's or nightingale's egg or
young linnet in exchange. Martin's ingenuity was therefore
forever on the rack to supply himself with a light;
just now he had hit upon a grand invention, and the den
was lighted by a flaring cotton-wick issuing from a ginger-beer
bottle full of some doleful composition. When
light altogether failed him, Martin would loaf about by
the fires in the passages or Hall, after the manner of
Diggs, and try to do his verses or learn his lines by the
fire-light.</p>

<h4>THE INVITATION.</h4>

<p>"Well, old boy, you haven't got any sweeter in the den
this half. How that stuff in the bottle smells! Never
mind, I'm not going to stop, but you come up after
prayers to our study; you know young Arthur; we've
got Gray's study. We'll have a good supper and talk
about birds' nesting."</p>

<p>Martin was evidently highly pleased at the invitation,
and promised to be up without fail.</p>

<p>As soon as prayers were over, and the sixth and fifth
form boys had withdrawn to the aristocratic seclusion of
their own rooms, and the rest, or democracy, had sat down
to their supper in the Hall, Tom and Arthur, having
secured their allowances of bread and cheese, started on
their feet to catch the eye of the pr&aelig;postor of the week,
who remained in charge during supper, walking up and
down the Hall. He happened to be an easy-going fellow,
so they got a pleasant nod to their "Please may I go out?"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
and away they scrambled to prepare for Martin a sumptuous
banquet. This, Tom had insisted on, for he was in
great delight on the occasion; the reason of which delight
must be expounded. The fact was that this was the first
attempt at a friendship of his own which Arthur had
made, and Tom hailed it as a grand step. The ease with
which he himself became hail-fellow-well-met with anybody,
and blundered into and out of twenty friendships
a half-year, made him sometimes sorry and sometimes
angry at Arthur's reserve and loneliness. True, Arthur
was always pleasant, and even jolly, with any boys who
came with Tom to their study; but Tom felt that it was
only through him, as it were, that his chum associated
with others, and that but for him Arthur would have
been dwelling in a wilderness. This increased his consciousness
of responsibility; and though he hadn't reasoned
it out and made it clear to himself, yet somehow he knew
that this responsibility, this trust which he had taken on
him without thinking about it, head-over-heels in fact,
was the centre and turning-point of his school-life, that
which was to make him or mar him; his appointed work
and trial for the time being. And Tom was becoming a
new boy, though with frequent tumbles in the dirt and
perpetual hard battle with himself, and was daily growing
in manfulness and thoughtfulness, as every high-couraged
and well-principled boy must, when he finds himself for
the first time consciously at grips with self and the devil.
Already he could turn almost without a sigh from the
School-gates, from which had just scampered off East
and three or four others of his own particular set, bound
for some jolly lark not quite according to law, and involving
probably a row with louts, keepers, or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
farm-laborers, the skipping dinner or calling-over, over some of
Phoebe Jennings' beer and a very possible flogging at the
end of all as a relish. He had quite got over the stage in
which he would grumble to himself; "Well, hang it, it's
very hard of the Doctor to have saddled me with Arthur.
Why couldn't he have chummed him with Fogey, or
Tompkin, or any of the fellows who never do anything
but walk round the close, and finish their copies the first
day they're set?" But although all this was past, he
longed, and felt that he was right in longing, for more
time for the legitimate pastimes of cricket, fives, bathing
and fishing within bounds, in which Arthur could not yet
be his companion; and he felt that when the young un (as
he now generally called him) had found a pursuit and
some other friend for himself, he should be able to give
more time to the education of his own body with a clear
conscience.</p>

<h4>TOM'S WORK.</h4>

<p>And now what he so wished for had come to pass; he
almost hailed it as a special providence (as indeed it was,
but not for the reasons he gave for it&mdash;what providences
are?) that Arthur should have singled out Martin of all
fellows for a friend. "The old Madman is the very fellow,"
thought he; "he will take him scrambling over half
the country after birds' eggs and flowers, make him run
and swim and climb like an Indian, and not teach him a
word of anything bad, or keep him from his lessons. What
luck!" And so, with more than his usual heartiness,
he dived into his cupboard and hauled out an old knucklebone
of ham, and two or three bottles of beer, together with
the solemn pewter<a name="FNanchor_16_544" id="FNanchor_16_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_544" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> only used on state occasions; while
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
Arthur, equally elated at the easy accomplishment of his
first act of volition<a name="FNanchor_17_545" id="FNanchor_17_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_545" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> in the joint establishment, produced
from his side a bottle of pickles and a pot of jam, and
cleared the table. In a minute or two the noise of the boys
coining up from supper was heard, and Martin knocked and
was admitted, bearing his bread and cheese, and the three
fell to with hearty good-will upon the viands, talking
faster than they ate, for all shyness disappeared in a
moment before Tom's bottled beer and hospitable ways.
"Here's Arthur a regular young town-mouse, with a natural
taste for the woods, Martin, longing to break his neck
climbing trees, and with a passion for young snakes."</p>

<h4>THE SUPPER.</h4>

<p>"Well, I say," spurted out Martin, eagerly, "will you
come to-morrow, both of you, to Caldecott's Spinney, then?
for I know of a kestrel's nest,<a name="FNanchor_18_546" id="FNanchor_18_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_546" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> up a fir-tree&mdash;I can't get
at it without help; and Brown, you can climb against
any one."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, do let us go," said Arthur; "I never saw a
hawk's nest, nor a hawk's egg."</p>

<p>"You just come down to my study, then, and I'll show
you five sorts," said Martin.</p>

<p>"Ay, the old Madman has got the best collection in the
house, out and out," said Tom; and then Martin, warming
with unaccustomed good cheer and the chance of a
convert, launched out into a proposed birds'-nesting campaign,
betraying all manner of important secrets; a golden-crested
wren's nest near Butlins's Mound, a moor-hen that
was sitting on nine eggs in a pond down the Barby road,
and a kingfisher's nest in a corner of the old canal above
Brownsover Mill. He had heard, he said, that no one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
had ever got a kingfisher's nest out perfect, and that the
British Museum or the Government, or somebody had
offered &pound;100 to any one who could bring them a nest and
eggs not damaged. In the middle of which astounding
announcement, to which the others were listening with
open ears, and already considering the application of the
&pound;100, a knock came at the door, and East's voice was
heard craving admittance.</p>

<p>"There's Harry," said Tom; "we'll let him in&mdash;I'll
keep him steady, Martin. I thought the old boy would
smell out the supper."</p>

<p>The fact was that Tom's heart had already smitten him
for not asking his "fidus Achates"<a name="FNanchor_19_547" id="FNanchor_19_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_547" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> to the feast, although
only an extempore<a name="FNanchor_20_548" id="FNanchor_20_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_548" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> affair; and, though prudence and the
desire to get Martin and Arthur together alone at first had
overcome his scruples, he was now heartily glad to open the
door, broach another bottle of beer, and hand over the old
ham-knuckle to the searching of his friend's pocket-knife.</p>

<p>"Ah, you greedy vagabonds!" said East, with his
mouth full, "I knew there was something going on when I
saw you cut off out of the Hall so quick with your suppers."</p>

<p>"Well, old Madman, and how goes the birds'-nesting
campaign? How's Howlett? I expect the young rooks'll
be out in another fortnight, and then my turn comes."</p>

<p>"There'll be no young rooks fit for pies for a month
yet; shows how much you know about it," rejoined Martin,
who, though very good friends with East, regarded
him with considerable suspicion for his propensity to
practical jokes.</p>

<p>"Scud knows nothing and cares for nothing but grub
and mischief," said Tom; "but young rook-pie, specially
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
when you've had to climb for the rooks, is very pretty eating.
However, I say, Scud, we're all going after a hawk's
nest to-morrow, in Caldecott's Spinney; and if you'll come
and behave yourself, we'll have a stunning climb."</p>

<p>"And a bathe in Aganippe.<a name="FNanchor_21_549" id="FNanchor_21_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_549" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Hooray! I'm your man."</p>

<p>"No; no bathing in Aganippe; that's where our betters go."</p>

<p>"Well, well, never mind. I'm for the hawk's nest and
anything that turns up."</p>

<p>And, his hunger appeased, East departed to his study;
"that sneak Jones," as he informed them, who had just
got into the sixth, and occupied the next study, having
instituted a nightly visitation upon East and his chum, to
their no small discomfort.</p>

<p>When he was gone, Martin rose to follow, but Tom
stopped him. "No one goes near New Row," said he, "so
you may just as well stop here and do your verses, and
then we'll have some more talk. We'll be no end quiet;
besides, no pr&aelig;postor comes here now&mdash;we havn't been
visited once this half."</p>

<p>So the table was cleared, the cloth restored, and the
three fell to work with Gradus and dictionary upon the
morning's Vulgus.</p>

<p>They were three very fair examples of the way in which
such tasks were done at Rugby, "in the consulship of Plancus."<a name="FNanchor_22_550" id="FNanchor_22_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_550" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
And doubtless the method is little changed, for there
is nothing new under the sun, especially at schools.</p>

<h4>VULGUSES.</h4>

<p>Now be it known unto all you boys who are at schools
which do not rejoice in the time-honored institution of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
the Vulgus (commonly supposed to have been established
by William of Wykeham<a name="FNanchor_23_551" id="FNanchor_23_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_551" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> at Winchester, and imported to
Rugby by Arnold, more for the sake of the lines which
were learnt by heart with it, than for its own intrinsic<a name="FNanchor_24_552" id="FNanchor_24_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_552" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
value, as I've always understood), that it is a short exercise,
in Greek or Latin verse, on a given subject, the
minimum<a name="FNanchor_25_553" id="FNanchor_25_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_553" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> number of lines being fixed for each form.
The master of the form gave out at fourth lesson on the
previous day the subject for next morning's Vulgus, and
at first lesson each boy had to bring his Vulgus ready to
be looked over; and with the Vulgus, a certain number of
lines from one of the Latin or Greek poets then being
construed in the form had to be got by heart. The master
at first lesson called up each boy in the form in order, and
put him on in the lines. If he couldn't say them, or
seem to say them, by reading them off the master's or
some other boy's book who stood near, he was sent back,
and went below all the boys who did so say or seem to
say them; but in either case his Vulgus was looked over
by the master, who gave and entered in his book, to the
credit or discredit of the boy, so many marks as the composition
merited. At Rugby, Vulgus and lines were the
first lesson every other day in the week, or Tuesdays,
Thursdays and Saturdays; and as there were thirty-eight
weeks in the school year, it is obvious to the meanest
capacity that the master of each form had to set one
hundred and fourteen subjects every year, two hundred
and twenty-eight every two years, and so on. Now to
persons of moderate invention this was a considerable
task, and human nature being prone to repeat itself, it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
will not be wondered that the master gave the same subjects
sometimes over again after a certain lapse of time.
To meet and rebuke this bad habit of the masters, the
schoolboy mind, with its accustomed ingenuity, had invented
an elaborate<a name="FNanchor_26_554" id="FNanchor_26_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_554" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> system of tradition. Almost every
boy kept his own Vulgus, written out in a book, and
these books were duly handed down from boy to boy, till
(if the tradition has gone on till now) I suppose the popular
boys, in whose hands bequeathed Vulgus-books have
accumulated, are prepared with three or four Vulguses on
any subject in heaven or earth, or in "more worlds than
one," which an unfortunate master can pitch upon. At
any rate, such lucky fellows had generally one for themselves
and one for a friend in my time. The only objection
to the traditionary method of doing your Vulguses
was, the risk that the successions might have become confused,
and so that you and another follower of traditions
should show up the same identical Vulgus some fine
morning; in which case, when it happened, considerable
grief was the result&mdash;but when did such risk hinder boys
or men from short cuts and pleasant paths?</p>

<h4>THE SCIENCE OF VERSE-MAKING.</h4>

<p>Now in the study that night, Tom was the upholder of
the traditionary method of Vulgus doing. He carefully
produced two large Vulgus books, and began diving into
them, and picking out a line here, and an ending there
(tags, as they were vulgarly called), till he had gotten all
that he thought he could make fit. He then proceeded to
patch his tags together with the help of his Gradus, producing
an incongruous<a name="FNanchor_27_555" id="FNanchor_27_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_555" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and feeble result of eight elegiac<a name="FNanchor_28_556" id="FNanchor_28_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_556" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
lines, the minimum quantity for his form, and finishing up
with two highly moral lines extra, making ten in all, which
he cribbed<a name="FNanchor_29_557" id="FNanchor_29_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_557" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> entire from one of his books, beginning, "O
genus humanum,"<a name="FNanchor_30_558" id="FNanchor_30_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_558" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> and which he himself must have used
a dozen times before, whenever an unfortunate or wicked
hero, of whatever nation or language under the sun, was
the subject. Indeed, he began to have great doubts
whether the master wouldn't remember them, and so
only threw them in as extra lines, because in any case
they would call off attention from the other tags, and if
detected, being extra lines, he wouldn't be sent back to
do two more in their place, while if they passed muster
again he would get marks for them.</p>

<p>The second method pursued by Martin may be called
the dogged, or prosaic, method. He, no more than Tom,
took any pleasure in the task, but having no old Vulgus
books of his own, or any one's else, could not follow the
traditionary method, for which, too, as Tom remarked, he
hadn't the genius. Martin then proceeded to write down
eight lines in English, of the most matter-of-fact kind, the
first that came into his head; and to convert these, line by
line, by main force of Gradus and dictionary, into Latin
that would scan.<a name="FNanchor_31_559" id="FNanchor_31_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_559" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> This was all he cared for, to produce
eight lines with no false quantities<a name="FNanchor_32_560" id="FNanchor_32_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_560" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> or concords;<a name="FNanchor_33_561" id="FNanchor_33_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_561" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> whether
the words were apt, or what the sense was, mattered nothing;
and, as the article was all new, not a line beyond the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
minimum did the followers of the dogged method ever
produce.</p>

<p>The third, or artistic method, was Arthur's. He considered
first what point in the character or event which
was the subject could most neatly be brought out within
the limits of a Vulgus; trying always to get his idea into
the eight lines, but not binding himself to ten or even
twelve lines if he couldn't do this. He then set to work,
as much as possible without Gradus or other help, to
clothe his idea in appropriate Latin or Greek, and would
not be satisfied till he had polished it well up with the
aptest and most poetic words and phrases he could get at.</p>

<p>A fourth method indeed was used in the school, but of
too simple a kind to require comment. It may be called
the vicarious<a name="FNanchor_34_562" id="FNanchor_34_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_562" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> method, obtained amongst big boys of lazy
or bullying habits, and consisted simply in making clever
boys whom they could thrash do their whole Vulgus for
them, and construe it to them afterward; which latter is
a method not to be encouraged, and which I strongly
advise you all not to practise. Of the others, you will
find the traditionary most troublesome, unless you can
steal the Vulguses whole (<i>experto crede</i>),<a name="FNanchor_35_563" id="FNanchor_35_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_563" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> and that the
artistic method pays the best, both in marks and other
ways.</p>

<h4>MARTIN'S DEN.</h4>

<p>The Vulguses being finished by nine o'clock, and Martin
having rejoiced above measure in the abundance of light,
and of Gradus and dictionary, and other conveniences
almost unknown to him for getting through the work, and
having been pressed by Arthur to come and do his verses
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
there whenever he liked, the three boys went down to
Martin's den, and Arthur was initiated into the lore of
birds' eggs, to his great delight. The exquisite coloring
and forms astonished and charmed him who had scarcely
even seen any but a hen's egg or an ostrich's, and by the
time he was lugged away to bed he had learned the names
of at least twenty sorts, and dreamed of the glorious perils
of tree climbing, and that he had found a roc's<a name="FNanchor_36_564" id="FNanchor_36_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_564" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> egg in the
island as big as Sindbad's<a name="FNanchor_37_565" id="FNanchor_37_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_565" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> and clouded like a titlark's, in
blowing<a name="FNanchor_38_566" id="FNanchor_38_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_566" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> which, Martin and he had nearly been drowned
in the yolk.</p>

<h4>TOM PUT OUT.</h4>

<p>The next morning at first lesson Tom was turned back
in his lines, and so had to wait till the second round,
while Martin and Arthur said theirs all right and got out
of school at once. When Tom got out and ran down to
breakfast at Harrowell's they were missing, and Stumps
informed him that they had swallowed down their breakfast
and gone off together,&mdash;where, he couldn't say. Tom
hurried over his own breakfast, and went first to Martin's
study and then to his own, but no signs of the missing
boys were to be found. He felt half angry and jealous of
Martin,&mdash;where could they be gone?</p>

<p>He learnt second lesson with East and the rest in no
very good temper, and then went out into the quadrangle.
About ten minutes before school Martin and Arthur
arrived in the quadrangle breathless, and catching sight
of him, Arthur rushed up all excitement and with a bright
glow on his face.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>
<p>"Oh, Tom, look here," cried he, holding out three moor-hen's
eggs; "we have been down the Barby road to the
pool Martin told us of last night, and just see what we've
got."</p>

<p>Tom wouldn't be pleased, and only looked out for something
to find fault with.</p>

<p>"Why, young un," said he, "what have you been after?
You don't mean to say you've been wading?"</p>

<p>The tone of reproach made poor little Arthur shrink up
in a moment and look piteous, and Tom, with a shrug of
his shoulders, turned his anger on Martin.</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't think, Madman, that you'd have been
such a muff as to let him be getting wet through at this
time of day. You might have done the wading yourself."</p>

<p>"So I did, of course, only he would come in, too, to see
the nest. We left six eggs in; they'll be hatched in a day
or two."</p>

<p>"Hang the eggs!" said Tom; "a fellow can't turn his
back for a moment, but all his work's undone. He'll be
laid up for a week for this precious lark, I'll be bound."</p>

<p>"Indeed, Tom, now," pleaded Arthur, "my feet aren't
wet, for Martin made me take off my shoes, stockings and
trousers."</p>

<p>"But they are wet and dirty, too&mdash;can't I see?"
answered Tom, "and you'll be called up and floored<a name="FNanchor_1_567" id="FNanchor_1_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_567" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
when the master sees what a state you're in. You haven't
looked at second lesson, you know." Oh, Tom, you old
humbug! you to be upbraiding any one with not learning
his lessons. If you hadn't been floored yourself now at
first lesson, do you mean to say you wouldn't have been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
with them? and you've taken away all poor little Arthur's
joy and pride in his first birds' eggs, and he goes and puts
them down in the study, and takes down his books with
a sigh, thinking he has done something horribly wrong,
whereas he has learnt on in advance much more than will
be done at second lesson.</p>

<p>But the old Madman hasn't, and gets called up and
makes some frightful shots, losing about ten places, and
all but getting floored. This somewhat appeases Tom's
wrath, and by the end of the lesson he has regained his
temper. And afterward in their study he begins to get
right again, as he watches Arthur's intense joy at seeing
Martin blowing the eggs and glueing them carefully on
to bits of cardboard, and notes the anxious, loving looks
which the little fellow casts sidelong at him. And then
he thinks, "What an ill-tempered beast I am! Here's
just what I was wishing for last night come about, and
I'm spoiling it all," and in another five minutes has swallowed
the last mouthful of his bile,<a name="FNanchor_2_568" id="FNanchor_2_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_568" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and is repaid by seeing
his little sensitive plant expand again, and sun itself
in his smiles.</p>

<p>After dinner the Madman is busy with the preparations
for their expedition, fitting new straps on to his climbing-irons,
filling large pill-boxes with cotton-wool, and sharpening
East's small axe. They carry all their munitions<a name="FNanchor_3_569" id="FNanchor_3_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_569" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
into calling-over, and directly afterward, having dodged
such pr&aelig;postors as are on the look-out for fags at cricket,
the four set off at a smart trot down the Lawford footpath
straight for Caldecott's Spinney and the hawk's nest.</p>

<h4>BIRDS'-NESTING.</h4>

<p>Martin leads the way in high feather.<a name="FNanchor_4_570" id="FNanchor_4_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_570" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> It is quite a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
new sensation to him getting companions, and he finds it
very pleasant, and means to show them all manner of
proofs of his science and skill. "Brown and East may be
better at cricket and foot-ball and games," thinks he, "but
out in the fields and woods see if I can't teach them something."
He has taken the leadership already, and strides
away in front, with his climbing-irons strapped under one
arm, his pecking-bag<a name="FNanchor_5_571" id="FNanchor_5_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_571" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> under the other, and his pockets
and hat full of pill-boxes, cotton-wool, and other et ceteras.<a name="FNanchor_6_572" id="FNanchor_6_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_572" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
Each of the others carries a pecking-bag, and East
his hatchet.</p>

<p>When they had crossed three or four fields without a
check, Arthur began to lag, and Tom seeing this shouted
to Martin to pull up a bit: "We aren't out Hare and
Hounds&mdash;what's the good of grinding on at this rate?"</p>

<p>"There's the spinney," said Martin, pulling up on the
brow of a slope, at the bottom of which lay Lawford brook,
and pointing to the top of the opposite slope; "the nest is
in one of those high fir-trees at this end. And down by
the brook there, I know of a sedge-bird's nest; we'll go
and look at it coming back."</p>

<p>"Oh, come on, don't let us stop," said Arthur, who was
getting excited at the sight of the wood; so they broke
into a trot again, and were soon across the brook, up the
slope, and into the spinney. Here they advanced as noiselessly
as possible, lest keepers or other enemies should be
about, and stopped at the foot of a tall fir, at the top of
which Martin pointed out with pride the kestrel's nest,
the object of their quest.</p>

<p>"Oh, where! which is it?" asks Arthur, gaping up in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
the air, and having the most vague idea of what it would
be like.</p>

<p>"There, don't you see!" said East, pointing to a lump
of mistletoe<a name="FNanchor_7_573" id="FNanchor_7_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_573" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> in the next tree, which was a beech; he saw
that Martin and Tom were busy with the climbing-irons,
and couldn't resist the temptation of hoaxing. Arthur
stared and wondered more than ever.</p>

<p>"Well, how curious! it doesn't look a bit like I expected,"
said he.</p>

<p>"Very odd birds, kestrels," said East, looking waggishly
at his victim who was still star-gazing.</p>

<p>"But I thought it was in a fir-tree?" objected Arthur.</p>

<p>"Ah, don't you know? that's a new sort of fir which old
Caldecott brought from the Himalayas."</p>

<p>"Really," said Arthur; "I'm glad I know that&mdash;how
unlike our firs they are! They do very well, too, here,
don't they? the spinney's full of them."</p>

<p>"What's that humbug he's telling you?" cried Tom,
looking up, having caught the word Himalayas, and suspecting
what East was after.</p>

<p>"Only about this fir," said Arthur, putting his hand on
the stem of the beech.</p>

<p>"Fir!" shouted Tom; "why, you don't mean to say,
young un, you don't know a beech when you see one?"</p>

<p>Poor little Arthur looked terribly ashamed, and East
exploded in laughter which made the wood ring.</p>

<p>"I've hardly ever seen any trees," faltered Arthur.</p>

<p>"What a shame to hoax him, Scud!" cried Martin.
"Never mind, Arthur you shall know more about trees
than he does in a week or two."</p>

<p>"And isn't that the kestrel's nest, then?" asked Arthur.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>
<p>"That! why that's a piece of mistletoe. There's the
nest, that lump of sticks up in this fir."</p>

<p>"Don't believe him, Arthur," struck in the incorrigible
East. "I just saw an old magpie go out of it."</p>

<p>Martin did not deign to reply to this sally, except by a
grunt, as he buckled the last buckle of his climbing-irons;
and Arthur looked reproachfully at East without speaking.</p>

<p>But now came the tug of war. It was a very difficult
tree to climb until the branches were reached, the first of
which was some fourteen feet up, for the trunk was too
large at the bottom to be swarmed;<a name="FNanchor_8_574" id="FNanchor_8_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_574" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> in fact, neither of the
boys could reach more than half round it with their arms.
Martin and Tom, both of whom had irons on, tried it without
success at first; the fir bark broke away where they
stuck the irons in as soon as they leaned any weight on
their feet, and the grip of their arms wasn't enough to
keep them up; so, after getting up three or four feet, down
they came slithering<a name="FNanchor_9_575" id="FNanchor_9_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_575" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> to the ground, barking their arms
and faces. They were furious, and East sat by laughing
and shouting at each failure: "Two to one on the old
magpie!"</p>

<p>"We must try a pyramid," said Tom at last. "Now,
Scud, you lazy rascal, stick yourself against the tree!"</p>

<p>"I dare say! and have you standing on my shoulders
with the irons on: what do you think my skin's made of?"
However, up he got, and leaned against the tree, putting
his head down and clasping it with his arms as far as he
could. "Now, then, Madman," said Tom, "you next."</p>

<p>"No, I'm lighter than you, you go next." So Tom
got on East's shoulders, and grasped the tree above, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
then Martin scrambled up on to Tom's shoulders, amidst
the totterings and the groanings of the pyramid, and, with
a spring which sent his supporters howling to the ground,
clasped the stem some ten feet up, and remained clinging;
for a moment or two they thought he couldn't get up,
but then, holding on with arms and teeth, he worked
first one iron, then the other firmly into the bark, got
another grip with his arms, and in another minute had
hold of the lowest branch.</p>

<p>"All up with old magpie now," said East; and, after a
minute's rest, up went Martin, hand over hand, watched
by Arthur with fearful eagerness.</p>

<p>"Isn't it very dangerous?" said he.</p>

<p>"Not a bit," answered Tom; "you can't hurt if you
only get a good hand-hold. Try every branch with a good
pull before you trust it, and then up you go."</p>

<p>Martin was now amongst the small branches close to the
nest, and away dashed the old bird, and soared up above
the trees, watching the intruder.</p>

<p>"All right&mdash;four eggs!" shouted he.</p>

<p>"Take' em all!" shouted East; "that'll be one apiece."</p>

<p>"No, no! leave one, and then she won't care," said
Tom.</p>

<p>We boys had an idea that birds couldn't count, and
were quite content as long as you left one egg. I hope it
is so.</p>

<p>Martin carefully put one egg into each of his boxes and
the third into his mouth, the only other place of safety,
and came down like a lamp-lighter. All went well till he
was within ten feet of the ground, when, as the trunk enlarged,
his hold got less and less firm, and at last down he
came with a run, tumbling on to his back on the turf,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
spluttering and spitting out the remains of the great egg,
which had broken by the jar of his fall.</p>

<p>"Ugh, ugh! something to drink&mdash;ugh! it was addled,"<a name="FNanchor_10_576" id="FNanchor_10_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_576" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
spluttered he, while the wood rang again with the merry
laughter of East and Tom.</p>

<p>Then they examined the prizes, gathered up their
things, and went off to the brook, where Martin swallowed
huge draughts of water to get rid of the taste; and they
visited the sedge-bird's<a name="FNanchor_11_577" id="FNanchor_11_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_577" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> nest, and from thence struck
across the country in high glee, beating<a name="FNanchor_12_578" id="FNanchor_12_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_578" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> the hedges and
brakes as they went along; and Arthur at last, to his intense
delight, was allowed to climb a small hedge-row oak
for a magpie's nest with Tom, who kept all around him
like a mother, and showed him where to hold and how to
throw his weight; and though he was in a great fright,
didn't show it; and was applauded by all for his lissomeness.</p>

<p>They crossed a road soon afterward, and there close to
them lay a heap of charming pebbles.</p>

<h4>PECKING.</h4>

<p>"Look here," shouted East, "here's luck! I've been
longing for some good honest pecking this half hour.
Let's fill the bags, and have no more of this foozling<a name="FNanchor_13_579" id="FNanchor_13_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_579" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> birds'-nesting."</p>

<p>No one objected, so each boy filled the fustian bag he
carried full of stones; they crossed into the next field,
Tom and East taking one side of the hedges, and the
other two the other side. Noise enough they made
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
certainly, but it was too early in the season for the young
birds, and the old birds were too strong on the wing for
our young marksmen, and flew out of shot after the first
discharge. But it was great fun, rushing along the hedgerows,
and discharging stone after stone at blackbirds and
chaffinches,<a name="FNanchor_14_580" id="FNanchor_14_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_580" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> though no result in the shape of slaughtered
birds was obtained; and Arthur soon entered into it, and
rushed to head back the birds, and shouted, and threw,
and tumbled into ditches and over and through hedges,
as wild as the Madman himself.</p>

<p>Presently the party, in full cry after an old blackbird
(who was evidently used to the thing and enjoyed the
fun, for he would wait till they came close to him and
then fly on for forty yards or so; and with an impudent
flicker of his tail, dart into the depths of the quickset),<a name="FNanchor_15_581" id="FNanchor_15_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_581" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
came beating down a high double hedge, two on each
side.</p>

<p>"There he is again;" "Head him;" "Let drive;" "I
had him there;" "Take care where you're throwing, Madman;"
the shouts might have been heard a quarter of a
mile off. They were heard some two hundred yards off
by a farmer and two of his shepherds, who were doctoring
sheep in a fold in the next field.</p>

<h4>WHAT IS LARCENY?</h4>

<p>Now the farmer in question rented a house and yard
situated at the end of the field in which the young bird-fanciers
had arrived, which house and yard he didn't occupy
or keep any one else in. Nevertheless, like a brainless
and unreasoning Briton, he persisted in maintaining
on the premises a large stock of cocks, hens, and other
poultry. Of course all sorts of depredators visited the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
place from time to time; foxes and gipsies wrought havoc
in the night; while in the day-time, I regret to have to
confess, that visits from the Rugby boys, and consequent
disappearances of ancient and respectable fowls, were not
unfrequent. Tom and East had during the period of
their outlawry visited the barn in question for felonious<a name="FNanchor_16_582" id="FNanchor_16_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_582" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
purposes, and on one occasion had conquered and slain a
duck there and borne away the carcass triumphantly,
hidden in their handkerchiefs. However, they were sickened
of the practice by the trouble and anxiety which the
wretched duck's body caused them. They carried it to
Sally Harrowell's, in hopes of a good supper; but she,
after examining it, made a long face, and refused to dress
or have anything to do with it.</p>

<h4>THE TROUBLESOME DUCK.</h4>

<p>Then they took it into their study, and began plucking
it themselves; but what to do with the feathers, where to
hide them?</p>

<p>"Good gracious, Tom, what a lot of feathers a duck
has!" groaned East, holding a bag full in his hand,
and looking disconsolately at the carcass, not yet half
plucked.</p>

<p>"And I do think he's getting high,<a name="FNanchor_17_583" id="FNanchor_17_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_583" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> too, already," said
Tom, smelling at him cautiously, "so we must finish him
up soon."</p>

<p>"Yes, all very well, but how are we to cook him? I'm
sure I'm not going to try it on in the hall or passages; we
can't afford to be roasting ducks about, our character's
too bad."</p>

<p>"I wish we were rid of the brute," said Tom, throwing
him on the table in disgust. And after a day or two
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
more it became clear that got rid of he must be; so they
packed him and sealed him up in brown paper, and put
him in the cupboard of an unoccupied study, where he
was found in the holidays by the matron, a grewsome
body.</p>

<p>They had never been duck-hunting there since, but
others had, and the bold yeoman was very sore on the
subject, and bent on making an example of the first boys
he could catch. So he and his shepherds crouched behind
the hurdles, and watched the party who were approaching
all unconscious.</p>

<p>Why should that old guinea-fowl be lying out in the
hedge just at this particular moment of all the year?
Who can say? Guinea-fowls always are&mdash;so are all other
things, animals, and persons&mdash;requisite for getting one
into scrapes, always ready when any mischief can come of
them. At any rate, just under East's nose popped out
the old guinea-hen, scuttling along and shrieking: "Come
back, come back," at the top of her voice. Either of the
other three might perhaps have withstood the temptation,
but East first lets drive the stone he has in his hand at her,
then rushes to turn her into the hedge again. He succeeds,
and then they are all at it for dear life, up and
down the hedge in full cry, the "Come back, come back,"
getting shriller and fainter every minute.</p>

<p>Meantime, the farmer and his men steal over the hurdles
and creep down the hedge toward the scene of action.
They are almost within a stone's throw of Martin, who is
pressing the unlucky chase hard, when Tom catches sight
of them, and sings out: "Louts, 'ware<a name="FNanchor_18_584" id="FNanchor_18_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_584" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> louts, your side! Madman,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
look ahead!" and then catching hold of Arthur,
hurries him away across the fields towards Rugby as hard
as they can tear. Had he been by himself, he would have
stayed to see it out with the others, but now his heart
sinks, and all his pluck goes. The idea of being led up
to the Doctor with Arthur for bagging fowls, quite unmans
and takes half the run out of him.</p>

<h4>RUNNING FOR A CONVOY.</h4>

<p>However, no boys are more able to take care of themselves
than East and Martin; they dodge the pursuers,
slip through a gap, and come pelting after Tom and Arthur,
whom they catch up in no time; the farmer and his
men are making a good run about a field behind. Tom
wishes to himself that they had made off in any other
direction, but now they are all in for it together and must
see it out. "You won't leave the young un, will you?"
says he, as they haul poor little Arthur, already losing
wind from the fright, through the next hedge. "Not
we," is the answer from both. The next hedge is a stiff
one; the pursuers gain horribly on them, and they only
just pull Arthur through, with two great rents in his
trousers, as the foremost shepherd comes up on the other
side. As they start into the next field, they are aware of
two figures walking down the footpath in the middle of it,
and recognize Holmes and Diggs taking a constitutional.<a name="FNanchor_19_585" id="FNanchor_19_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_585" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
Those good-natured fellows immediately shout "On."
"Let's go to them and surrender," pants Tom. Agreed.
And in another minute the four boys, to the great astonishment
of those worthies, rush breathless up to Holmes
and Diggs, who pull up to see what is the matter; and
then the whole is explained by the appearance of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
farmer and his men, who unite their forces and bear down
on the knot of boys.</p>

<p>There is no time to explain, and Tom's heart beats
frightfully quick, as he ponders: "Will they stand by
us?"</p>

<p>The farmer makes a rush at East, and collars him; and
that young gentleman, with unusual discretion, instead of
kicking his shins, looks appealingly at Holmes, and stands
still.</p>

<p>"Hullo there, not so fast," says Holmes, who is bound
to stand up for them till they are proved in the wrong.
"Now, what's all this about?"</p>

<p>"I've got the young varmint at last, have I?" pants the
farmer; "why, they've been a-skulking about my yard
and stealing my fowls, that's where 'tis; and if I doan't
have they flogged for it, every one on 'em, my name ain't
Thompson."</p>

<h4>A DEBATE.</h4>

<p>Holmes looks grave, and Diggs's face falls. They are
quite ready to fight, no boys in the school more so; but
they are pr&aelig;postors, and understand their office; and can't
uphold unrighteous causes.</p>

<p>"I haven't been near his old barn this half," cries East.</p>

<p>"Nor I," "Nor I," chime in Tom and Martin.</p>

<p>"Now, Willum, didn't you see 'em there last week?"</p>

<p>"Ees,"<a name="FNanchor_20_586" id="FNanchor_20_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_586" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> seen 'em, sure enough," says Willum, grasping
a prong he carried, and preparing for action.</p>

<p>The boys deny stoutly, and Willum is driven to admit
that, "if it worn't they, 'twas chaps as like 'em as two
peas'n";<a name="FNanchor_21_587" id="FNanchor_21_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_587" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and "leastway,<a name="FNanchor_22_588" id="FNanchor_22_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_588" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> he'll swear he see'd them two
in the yard last Martinmas," indicating East and Tom.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>
<p>Holmes has had time to meditate. "Now, sir," says he
to Willum, "you see you can't remember what you have
seen, and I believe the boys."</p>

<p>"I doan't care," blusters the farmer, "they was arter
my fowls to-day; that's enough for I. Willum, you catch
hold o' t'other chap. They've been a-sneaking about this
two hours, I tells ee!" shouted he, as Holmes stands between
Martin and Willum, "and have druv a matter of a
dozen young pullets pretty nigh to death."</p>

<p>"Oh, there's a whacker!" cried East; "we haven't been
within a hundred yards of his barn; we haven't been up
here above ten minutes, and we've seen nothing but a
tough old guinea-hen, who ran like a greyhound."</p>

<p>"Indeed, that's all true, Holmes, upon my honor," added
Tom; "we weren't after his fowls; guinea-hen ran out of
the hedge under our feet, and we've seen nothing else."</p>

<p>"Drat their talk! Thee catch hold o' t'other, Willum,
and come along wi' un."</p>

<p>"Farmer Thompson," said Holmes, warning off Willum
and the prong with his stick, while Diggs faced the other
shepherd, cracking his fingers like pistol-shots, "now listen
to reason. The boys haven't been after your fowls, that's
plain."</p>

<p>"Tells ee I seed 'em. Who be you, I should like to know?"</p>

<p>"Never you mind, farmer," answered Holmes. "And
now I'll just tell you what it is&mdash;you ought to be ashamed
of yourself for leaving all that poultry about, with no one
to watch it, so near the School. You deserve to have it
all stolen. So if you choose to come up to the Doctor
with them, I shall go with you, and tell him what I think
of it."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>
<p>The farmer began to take Holmes for a master; besides,
he wanted to get back to his flock. Corporal punishment
was out of the question, the odds were too great; so he
began to hint at paying for the damage. Arthur jumped
at this, offering to pay anything, and the farmer immediately
valued the guinea-hen at half a sovereign.</p>

<p>"Half a sovereign!" cried East, now released from the
farmer's grip; "well, that is a good one! the old hen isn't
hurt a bit, and she's seven years old, I know, and as tough
as whipcord; she couldn't lay another egg to save her
life."</p>

<p>It was at last settled that they should pay the farmer
two shillings and his man one shilling, and so the matter
ended, to the unspeakable relief of Tom, who hadn't been
able to say a word, being sick at heart at the idea of what
the Doctor would think of him; and now the whole party
of boys marched off down the woodpath toward Rugby.
Holmes, who was one of the best boys in the school, began
to improve the occasion. "Now, you youngsters,"
said he, as he marched along in the middle of them,
"mind this: you're very well out of this scrape. Don't
you go near Thompson's barn again, do you hear?"</p>

<p>Profuse promises from all, especially East.</p>

<h4>LECTURE ON SCHOOL LARCENY.</h4>

<p>"Mind, I don't ask questions," went on Mentor, "but
I rather think some of you have been there before this
after his chickens. Now, knocking over other people's
chickens, and running off with them is stealing. It's an
ugly word, but that's the plain English of it. If the
chickens were dead and lying in a shop, you wouldn't take
them, I know that, any more than you would apples out
of Griffith's basket: but there's no real difference between
chickens running about and apples on a tree, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
same articles in a shop. I wish our morals were sounder
in such matters. There's nothing so mischievous as these
school distinctions, which jumble up right and wrong,
and justify things in us for which poor boys would be
sent to prison." And good old Holmes delivered his soul
on the walk home of many wise sayings, and, as the song
says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
"Gee'd 'em<a name="FNanchor_23_589" id="FNanchor_23_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_589" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> a sight of good advice";<br />
</p></div>

<p>which same sermon sank into them all more or less, and
very penitent they were for several hours. But truth
compels me to admit that East at any rate forgot it all in
a week, but remembered the insult which had been put
upon him by Farmer Thompson, and with the Tadpole
and other hare-brained youngsters, committed a raid on
the barn soon afterward, in which they were caught by
the shepherds and severely handled, besides having to pay
eight shillings&mdash;all the money they had in the world&mdash;to
escape being brought up to the Doctor.</p>

<h4>ARTHUR SEALS HIS FRIENDSHIP.</h4>

<p>Martin became a constant inmate in the joint study
from this time, and Arthur took to him so kindly that
Tom couldn't resist slight fits of jealousy, which, however,
he managed to keep to himself. The kestrel's eggs
had not been broken, strange to say, and formed the
nucleus of Arthur's collection, at which Martin worked
heart and soul; and introduced Arthur to Hewlett the
bird-fancier, and instructed him in the rudiments of the
art of stuffing. In token of his gratitude, Arthur allowed
Martin to tattoo a small anchor on one of his wrists,
which decoration, however, he carefully concealed from
Tom. Before the end of the half-year he had become
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
a bold climber and good runner, and, as Martin had foretold,
knew twice as much about trees, birds, flowers, and
many other things, as our good-hearted and facetious
young friend Harry East.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>THE FIGHT.</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class="poem"><p>
"Surgebat Macnevisius<br />
Et mox jactabat ultro,<br />
Pugnabo tu&acirc; grati&acirc;<br />
Feroci hoc Mactwoltro."&mdash;<i>Etonian.</i><br />
</p></div>
</div>

<h4>FIGHTING IN GENERAL.</h4>

<p>There is a certain sort of fellow&mdash;we who are used
to studying boys all know him well enough&mdash;of
whom you can predicate<a name="FNanchor_1_590" id="FNanchor_1_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_590" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> with almost positive certainty,
after he has been a month at school, that he is sure to
have a fight, and with almost equal certainty that he will
have but one. Tom Brown was one of these; and as it is
our well-weighed intention to give a full, true, and correct
account of Tom's only single combat with a schoolfellow
in the manner of our old friend <i>Bell's Life</i>,<a name="FNanchor_2_591" id="FNanchor_2_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_591" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> let
those young persons whose stomachs are not strong, or
who think a good set-to with the weapons which God has
given us all, an uncivilized, unchristian, or ungentlemanly
affair, just skip this chapter at once, for it won't be to
their taste.</p>

<p>It was not at all usual in those days for two School-house
boys to have a fight. Of course there were exceptions,
when some cross-grained, hard-headed fellow came
up who would never be happy unless he was quarrelling
with his nearest neighbors, or when there was some class
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
dispute between the fifth form and the fags, for instance,
which required blood-letting; and a champion was picked
out on each side tacitly,<a name="FNanchor_3_592" id="FNanchor_3_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_592" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> who settled the matter by a good
hearty mill.<a name="FNanchor_4_593" id="FNanchor_4_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_593" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> But, for the most part, the constant use of
those surest keepers of the peace, the boxing gloves, kept
the School-house boys from fighting one another. Two or
three nights in every week the gloves were brought out,
either in the hall or fifth form room; and every boy who was
ever likely to fight at all knew all his neighbors' prowess
perfectly well, and could tell to a nicety what chance he
would have in a stand-up fight with any other boy in the
house. But, of course, no such experience could be gotten
as regarded boys in other houses; and as most of the
other houses were more or less jealous of the School-house,
collisions were frequent.</p>

<p>After all, what would life be without fighting, I should
like to know? From the cradle to the grave, fighting,
rightly understood, is the business, the real, highest, honestest
business of every son of man. Every one who is
worth his salt has his enemies, who must be beaten, be
they evil thoughts and habits in himself or spiritual wickedness
in high places, or Russians, or Border-ruffians, or
Bill, Tom, or Harry, who will not let him live his life in
quiet till he has thrashed them.</p>

<p>It is no good for Quakers, or any other body of men, to
uplift their voices against fighting. Human nature is too
strong for them, and they don't follow their own precepts.
Every soul of them is doing his own piece of fighting,
somehow and somewhere. The world might be a better
world without fighting, for anything I know, but it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
wouldn't be our world; and therefore I am dead against
crying peace when there is no peace, and isn't meant to
be. I am as sorry as any man to see folks fighting the
wrong people and the wrong things, but I'd a deal sooner
see them doing that, than that they should have no fight
in them. So having recorded, and being about to record,
my hero's fights of all sorts, with all sorts of enemies, I
shall now proceed to give an account of his passage-at-arms
with the only one of his school-fellows whom he ever had
to encounter in this manner.</p>

<h4>HOW THE FIGHT AROSE.</h4>

<p>It was drawing toward the close of Arthur's first half-year,
and the May evenings were lengthening out. Locking-up
was not till eight o'clock, and everybody was beginning
to talk about what he would do in the holidays.
The shell, in which form all our <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i><a name="FNanchor_5_594" id="FNanchor_5_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_594" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> now
are, were reading amongst other things the last book of
Homer's "Iliad,"<a name="FNanchor_6_595" id="FNanchor_6_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_595" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and had worked through it as far as the
speeches of the women over Hector's<a name="FNanchor_7_596" id="FNanchor_7_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_596" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> body. It is a whole
school-day, and four or five of the School-house boys
(amongst whom are Arthur, Tom, and East) are preparing
third lesson together. They have finished the regulation
forty lines, and are for the most part getting very tired,
notwithstanding the exquisite pathos of Helen's<a name="FNanchor_8_597" id="FNanchor_8_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_597" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> lamentation.
And now several long four-syllable words come
together, and the boy with the dictionary strikes work.</p>

<p>"I am not going to look out any more words," says he;
"we've done the quantity. Ten to one we sha'n't get so
far. Let's go out into the close."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
"Come along, boys," cries East, always ready to leave
"the grind," as he called it; "our old coach<a name="FNanchor_9_598" id="FNanchor_9_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_598" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> is laid up,
you know, and we shall have one of the new masters,
who's sure to go slow and let us down easy."</p>

<p>So an adjournment to the close was carried <i>nem con.</i>,<a name="FNanchor_10_599" id="FNanchor_10_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_599" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
little Arthur not daring to uplift his voice; but, being
deeply interested in what they were reading, stayed quietly
behind, and learned on for his own pleasure.</p>

<p>As East had said, the regular master of the form was
unwell, and they were to be heard by one of the new masters,
quite a young man, who had only just left the university.
Certainly it would be hard lines, if, by dawdling
as much as possible in coming in and taking their
places, entering into long-winded explanations of what was
the usual course of the regular master of the form, and
others of the stock contrivances of boys for wasting time
in school, they could not spin out the lesson so that he
should not work them through more than the forty lines;
as to which quantity there was a perpetual fight going on
between the master and his form, the latter insisting, and
enforcing by passive resistance, that it was the prescribed
quantity of Homer for a shell lesson,<a name="FNanchor_11_600" id="FNanchor_11_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_600" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> the former that there
was no fixed quantity, but that they must always be ready
to go on to fifty or sixty lines if there were time within
the hour. However, notwithstanding all their efforts,
the new master got on horribly quick; he seemed to have
the bad taste to be really interested in the lesson, and to
be trying to work them up into something like appreciation
of it, giving them good spirited English words, instead
of the wretched bald stuff into which they rendered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
poor old Homer, and construing over each piece himself to
them, after each boy, to show them how it should be done.</p>

<p>Now the clock strikes the three-quarters; there is only
a quarter of an hour more, but the forty lines are all but
done. So the boys, one after another, who are called up,
stick more and more, and make balder and even more
bald work of it. The poor young master is pretty near
beat by this time, and feels ready to knock his head
against the wall, or his fingers against somebody else's
head. So he gives up altogether the lower and middle
parts of the form, and looks around in despair at the boys
on the top bench, to see if there is one out of whom he
can strike a spark or two, and who will be too chivalrous<a name="FNanchor_12_601" id="FNanchor_12_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_601" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
to murder the most beautiful utterances of the most beautiful
woman of the old world. His eye rests on Arthur,
and he calls him up to finish construing Helen's speech.
Whereupon all the other boys draw long breaths, and
begin to stare about and take it easy. They are all safe;
Arthur is at the head of the form, and sure to be able to
construe, and that will tide on safely till the hour strikes.</p>

<p>Arthur proceeds to read out the passage in Greek before
construing it, as the custom is. Tom, who isn't paying
much attention, is suddenly caught by the falter in
his voice as he reads the two lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><p>
[Greek: "alla su ton g' epeessi paraiphamenos katerukes,<br />
s&ecirc; t' aganophrosun&ecirc; kai sois aganois epeessin."]<a name="FNanchor_13_602" id="FNanchor_13_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_602" class="fnanchor">[13]</a><br />
</p></div>

<p>He looks up at Arthur. "Why, bless us," thinks he,
"what can be the matter with the young un? He's never
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
going to get floored! He's sure to have learnt to the
end!" Next moment he is reassured by the spirited tone
in which Arthur begins construing, and betakes himself
to drawing dogs' heads in his note-book, while the master,
evidently enjoying the change, turns his back on the
middle bench, and stands before Arthur, beating a sort of
time with his hand and foot, and saying: "Yes, yes,"
"Very well," as Arthur goes on.</p>

<p>But as he nears the fatal two lines, Tom catches that
falter, and again looks up. He sees that there is something
the matter: Arthur can hardly get on at all. What
can it be?</p>

<p>Suddenly at this point Arthur breaks down altogether,
and fairly bursts out crying, and dashes the cuff of his
jacket across his eyes, blushing up to the roots of his hair,
and feeling as if he should like to go down suddenly
through the floor. The whole form are taken aback;
most of them stare stupidly at him, while those who are
gifted with presence of mind find their places, and look
steadily at their books, in hopes of not catching the master's
eye, and getting called up in Arthur's place.</p>

<p>The master looked puzzled for a moment, and then
seeing, as the fact is, that the boy is really affected to tears
by the most touching thing in Homer, perhaps in all profane<a name="FNanchor_14_603" id="FNanchor_14_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_603" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
poetry put together, steps up to him and lays his
hand kindly on his shoulder, saying: "Never mind, my
little man, you've construed very well. Stop a minute,
there's no hurry."</p>

<p>Now, as luck would have it, there sat next above Tom
on that day, in the middle bench of the form, a big boy,
by name Williams, generally supposed to be the cock of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
the shell, therefore of all the schools below the fifths. The
small boys, who are great speculators on the prowess of
their elders, used to hold forth to one another about
Williams's great strength, and to discuss whether East or
Brown would take a licking from him. He was called Slogger<a name="FNanchor_15_604" id="FNanchor_15_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_604" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
Williams, from the force with which it was supposed
he could hit. In the main, he was a rough, good-natured
fellow enough, but very much alive to his own dignity.
He reckoned himself the king of the form, and kept up
his position with the strong hand, especially in the matter
of forcing boys not to construe more than the legitimate
forty lines. He had already grunted and grumbled to
himself, when Arthur went on reading beyond the forty
lines. But now that he had broken down just in the
middle of all the long words, the Slogger's wrath was fairly
aroused.</p>

<p>"Sneaking little brute," muttered he, regardless of
prudence, "clapping on the water-works just in the hardest
place; see if I don't punch his head after fourth lesson."</p>

<p>"Whose?" said Tom, to whom the remark seemed addressed.</p>

<p>"Why, that little sneak Arthur's," replied Williams.</p>

<p>"No, you sha'n't," said Tom.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" exclaimed Williams, looking at Tom with
great surprise for a moment, and then giving him a sudden
dig in the ribs with his elbow, which sent Tom's book
flying on to the floor, and called the attention of the master,
who turned suddenly round, and seeing the state of
things, said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Williams, go down three places, and then go on."</p>

<p>The Slogger found his legs very slowly, and proceeded
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
to go below Tom and two other boys with great disgust,
and then, turning round and facing the master, said: "I
haven't learnt any more, sir; our lesson is only forty
lines."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" said the master, appealing generally to
the top bench. No answer.</p>

<p>"Who is the head boy of the form?" said he, waxing
wroth.</p>

<p>"Arthur, sir," answered three or four boys, indicating
our friend.</p>

<p>"Oh, your name's Arthur. Well, now, what is the
length of your regular lesson?"</p>

<p>Arthur hesitated a moment, and then said: "We call
it only forty lines, sir."</p>

<p>"How do you mean, you call it?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, Mr. Graham says we aren't to stop there,
when there's time to construe more."</p>

<p>"I understand," said the master. "Williams, go down
three more places, and write me out the lesson in Greek
and English. And now, Arthur, finish construing."</p>

<p>"Oh, would I be in Arthur's shoes after fourth lesson?"
said the little boys to one another: but Arthur finished
Helen's speech without any further catastrophe, and the
clock struck four, which ended third lesson.</p>

<p>Another hour was occupied in preparing and saying
fourth lesson, during which Williams was bottling up his
wrath; and when five struck, and the lessons for the day
were over, he prepared to take summary<a name="FNanchor_16_605" id="FNanchor_16_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_605" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> vengeance on
the innocent cause of his misfortune.</p>

<h4>THE CHALLENGE.</h4>

<p>Tom was detained in school a few minutes after the
rest, and on coming out into the quadrangle, the first
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
thing he saw was a small ring of boys, applauding Williams,
who was holding Arthur by the collar.</p>

<p>"There, you young sneak," said he, giving Arthur a
cuff on the head with his other hand, "what made you say
that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hullo!" said Tom, shouldering into the crowd, "you
drop that, Williams; you sha'n't touch him."</p>

<p>"Who'll stop me?" said the Slogger, raising his hand
again.</p>

<p>"I," said Tom; and suiting the action to the word, he
struck the arm which held Arthur's arm so sharply that
the Slogger dropped it with a start, and turned the full
current of his wrath on Tom.</p>

<p>"Will you fight?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course."</p>

<p>"Huzzah! there is going to be a fight between Slogger
Williams and Tom Brown."</p>

<p>The news ran like wildfire about, and many boys who
were on their way to tea at their several houses turned
back, and sought the back of the chapel, where the fights
came off.</p>

<p>"Just run and tell East to come and back me," said
Tom, to a small School-house boy, who was off like a
rocket to Harrowell's, just stopping for a moment to poke
his head into the School-house hall, where the lower boys
were already at tea, and singing out: "Fight! Tom
Brown and Slogger Williams."</p>

<p>Up start half the boys at once, leaving bread, eggs,
butter, sprats<a name="FNanchor_17_606" id="FNanchor_17_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_606" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>, and all the rest to take care of themselves.
The greater part of the remainder follow in a minute,
after swallowing their tea, carrying their food in their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
hands to consume as they go. Three or four only remain,
who steal the butter of the more impetuous, and make to
themselves an unctuous<a name="FNanchor_18_607" id="FNanchor_18_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_607" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> feast.</p>

<p>In another minute East and Martin tear through the
quadrangle, carrying a sponge, and arrive at the scene of
action just as the combatants are beginning to strip.</p>

<p>Tom felt he had got his work cut out<a name="FNanchor_19_608" id="FNanchor_19_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_608" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> for him, as he
stripped off his jacket, waistcoat, and braces. East tied
his handkerchief round his waist, and rolled up his shirt-sleeves
for him. "Now, old boy, don't you open your
mouth to say a word, or try to help yourself a bit&mdash;we'll
do all that; you keep all your breath and strength for the
Slogger." Martin meanwhile folded the clothes, and put
them under the chapel rails; and now Tom, with East to
handle him, and Martin to give him a knee,<a name="FNanchor_20_609" id="FNanchor_20_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_609" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> steps out on
the turf, and is ready for all that may come; and here is
the Slogger too, all stripped, and thirsting for the fray.</p>

<h4>EARLY ROUNDS.</h4>

<p>It doesn't look a fair match at first glance; Williams is
nearly two inches taller, and probably a long year older
than his opponent, and he is very strongly made about the
arms and shoulders&mdash;"peels well," as the little knot of
big fifth-form boys, the amateurs,<a name="FNanchor_21_610" id="FNanchor_21_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_610" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> say; who stand outside
the ring of little boys, looking complacently on, but taking
no active part in the proceedings. But down below
he is not so good by any means; no spring from the loins,
and feeblish, not to say shipwrecky about the knees.
Tom, on the contrary, though not half so strong in the
arms, is good all over, straight, hard, and springy, from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
neck to ankle, better perhaps in his legs than anywhere.
Besides, you can see by the clear white of his eye, and
fresh bright look of his skin, that he is in tip-top training,
able to do all he knows; while the Slogger looks rather
sodden,<a name="FNanchor_22_611" id="FNanchor_22_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_611" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> as if he didn't take much exercise and ate too
much tuck.<a name="FNanchor_23_612" id="FNanchor_23_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_612" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> The time-keeper is chosen, a large ring made,
and the two stand up opposite one another for a moment,
giving us time just to make our little observations.</p>

<p>"If Tom'll only condescend to fight with his head and
heels," as East murmurs to Martin, "we shall do."</p>

<p>But seemingly he won't, for there he goes in, making
play<a name="FNanchor_24_613" id="FNanchor_24_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_613" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> with both hands. Hard all,<a name="FNanchor_25_614" id="FNanchor_25_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_614" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> is the word; the two
stand to one another like men; rally follows rally in quick
succession, each fighting as if he thought to finish the
whole thing out of hand. "Can't last at this rate," say
the knowing ones, while the partisans<a name="FNanchor_26_615" id="FNanchor_26_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_615" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> of each make the
air ring with their shouts and counter-shouts of encouragement,
approval and defiance.</p>

<p>"Take it easy, take it easy&mdash;keep away, let him come
after you," implores East, as he wipes Tom's face after the
first round with a wet sponge, while he sits back on Martin's
knee, supported by the Madman's long arms, which
tremble a little from excitement.</p>

<p>"Time's up," calls the time-keeper.</p>

<p>"There he goes again, hang it all!" growled East, as
his man is at it again as hard as ever. A very severe
round follows, in which Tom gets out and out the worst
of it, and is at last hit clean off his legs, and deposited
on the grass by a right-hander from the Slogger.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>
<p>Loud shouts rise from the boys of Slogger's house and
the School-house are silent and vicious, ready to pick
quarrels anywhere.</p>

<p>"Two to one in half-crowns on the big un," says Rattle,
one of the amateurs, a tall fellow, in thunder-and-lightning<a name="FNanchor_27_616" id="FNanchor_27_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_616" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
waistcoat, and puffy, good-natured face.</p>

<p>"Done!" says Groove, another amateur of quieter look,
taking out his note-book to enter it, for our friend Rattle
sometimes forgets these little things.</p>

<h4>HEAD FIGHTING.</h4>

<p>Meantime East is freshening up Tom with the sponges
for next round, and has set two other boys to rub his
hands.</p>

<p>"Tom, old boy," whispers he, "this may be fun for you,
but it's death to me. He'll hit all the fight out of you in
another five minutes, and then I shall go and drown myself
in the Island ditch. Feint<a name="FNanchor_28_617" id="FNanchor_28_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_617" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> him&mdash;use your legs!
draw him about! he'll lose his wind then in no time, and
you can go into him. Hit at his body too; take care of
his frontispiece<a name="FNanchor_29_618" id="FNanchor_29_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_618" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> by and by."</p>

<p>Tom felt the wisdom of the counsel, and saw already
that he couldn't go in and finish the Slogger off at mere
hammer and tongs, so changed his tactics completely in
the third round. He now fights cautiously, getting away
from and parrying<a name="FNanchor_30_619" id="FNanchor_30_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_619" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> the Slogger's lunging hits,<a name="FNanchor_31_620" id="FNanchor_31_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_620" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> instead of
trying to counter,<a name="FNanchor_32_621" id="FNanchor_32_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_621" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> and leading his enemy a dance all
round the ring after him. "He's funking&mdash;go in, Williams;"
"Catch him up;" "Finish him off," screamed
the small boys of the Slogger party.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>
<p>"Just what we want," thinks East, chuckling to himself,
as he sees Williams, excited by these shouts and
thinking the game in his own hands, blowing himself in
his exertions to get close quarters again, while Tom is keeping
away with perfect ease.</p>

<p>They quarter<a name="FNanchor_33_622" id="FNanchor_33_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_622" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> over the ground again and again, Tom
always on the defensive.</p>

<p>The Slogger pulls up at last for a moment, fairly blown.<a name="FNanchor_34_623" id="FNanchor_34_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_623" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>"Now, then, Tom," sings out East, dancing with delight.
Tom goes in in a twinkling, and hits two heavy
body-blows, and gets away again before the Slogger can
catch his wind; which when he does he rushes with blind
fury at Tom, and being skilfully parried and avoided,
overreaches himself and falls on his face, amidst terrific
cheers from the School-house boys.</p>

<p>"Double your two to one?" says Groove to Rattle,
note-book in hand.</p>

<p>"Stop a bit," says that hero, looking uncomfortably at
Williams, who is puffing away on his second's knee,
winded<a name="FNanchor_35_624" id="FNanchor_35_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_624" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> enough, but little the worse in any other way.</p>

<h4>STEADY ALL.</h4>

<p>After another round the Slogger too seems to see that
he can't go in and win right off, and has met his match or
thereabouts. So he too begins to use his head,<a name="FNanchor_36_625" id="FNanchor_36_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_625" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> and tries
to make Tom lose his patience, and come in before his
time. And so the fight sways on, now one, and now the
other getting a trifling pull.<a name="FNanchor_37_626" id="FNanchor_37_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_626" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>Tom's face begins to look very one-sided,&mdash;there are
little queer bumps on his forehead, and his mouth is bleeding;
but East keeps the wet sponge going so scientifically
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
that he comes up looking as fresh and bright as ever.
Williams is only slightly marked in the face, but by the
nervous movement of his elbows you can see that Tom's
body-blows are telling. In fact, half the vice of the Slogger's
hitting is neutralized, for he daren't lunge out freely
for fear of exposing his sides. It is too interesting by this
time for much shouting, and the whole ring is very quiet.</p>

<p>"All right, Tommy," whispers East; "hold on's the
horse that's to win. We've got the last. Keep your head,<a name="FNanchor_38_627" id="FNanchor_38_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_627" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
old boy."</p>

<p>But where is Arthur all this time? Words cannot
paint the poor little fellow's distress. He couldn't muster
courage to come up to the ring, but wandered up and
down from the great fives' court to the corner of the
chapel rails&mdash;now trying to make up his mind to throw
himself between them, and try to stop them; then thinking
of running in and telling his friend Mary, who he
knew would instantly report to the Doctor. The stories
he had heard of men being killed in prize fights rose up
horribly before him.</p>

<p>Once only, when the shouts of "Well done, Brown!"
"Huzzah for the School-house!" rose higher than ever,
he ventured up to the ring, thinking the victory was won.
Catching sight of Tom's face in the state I have described,
all fear of consequences vanishing out of his mind, he
rushed straight off to the matron's room, beseeching her to
get the fight stopped, or he should die.</p>

<h4>THE RING BROKEN.</h4>

<p>But it's time for us to get back to the close. What is
this fierce tumult and confusion? The ring is broken,
and high and angry words are being bandied about; "It's
all fair"&mdash;"It isn't"&mdash;"No hugging;" the fight is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
stopped. The combatants, however, sit there quietly,
tended by their seconds, while their adherents wrangle in
the middle. East can't help shouting challenges to two
or three of the other side, though he never leaves Tom
for a moment, and plies the sponges as fast as ever.</p>

<p>The fact is, that at the end of the last round, Tom,
seeing a good opening, had closed with his opponent, and
after a moment's struggle, had thrown him heavily, by
the help of the fall he had learned from his village rival
in the Vale of White Horse. Williams hadn't the ghost
of a chance with Tom at wrestling, and the conviction
broke at once on the Slogger faction that if this were
allowed, their man must be licked. There was a strong
feeling in the School against catching hold and throwing,
though it was generally ruled all fair within certain limits;
so the ring was broken, and the fight stopped.</p>

<p>The School-house are overruled&mdash;the fight is on again,
but there is to be no throwing; and East, in high wrath,
threatens to take his man away after next round (which
he doesn't mean to do, by the way), when suddenly young
Brooke comes through the small gate at the end of the
chapel. The School-house faction rush to him. "Oh,
hurrah! now we shall get fair play."</p>

<p>"Please, Brooke come up; they won't let Tom Brown
throw him."</p>

<p>"Throw whom?" says Brooke, coming up to the ring.
"Oh, Williams! I see. Nonsense! of course he may
throw him, if he catches him fairly above the waist."</p>

<p>Now, young Brooke, you're in the sixth you know, and
you ought to stop all fights. He looks hard at both
boys. "Anything wrong?" says he to East, nodding at
Tom.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>
<p>"Not a bit."</p>

<p>"Not beat at all?"</p>

<p>"Bless you, no! heaps of fight in him. Isn't there,
Tom?"</p>

<p>Tom looked at Brooke and grins. "How's he?" nodding
at Williams.</p>

<p>"So so; rather done, I think, since, his last fall. He
won't stand above two more."</p>

<h4>THE LAST ROUND.</h4>

<p>"Time's up!" The boys rise again, and face one another.
Brooke can't find it in his heart to stop them just
yet; so the round goes on, the Slogger waiting for Tom,
and reserving all his strength to hit him out should he
come in for the wrestling dodge again; for he feels that
that must be stopped, or his sponge<a name="FNanchor_39_628" id="FNanchor_39_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_628" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> will soon go up in the air.</p>

<p>And now another new-comer appears on the field, to
wit, the under-porter, with his long brush and great
wooden receptacle for dust under his arm. He has been
sweeping out the schools.</p>

<p>"You'd better stop, gentlemen," he says; "the Doctor
knows that Brown's fighting&mdash;he'll be out in a minute."</p>

<p>"You go to Bath,<a name="FNanchor_40_629" id="FNanchor_40_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_629" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Bill," is all that that excellent servitor
gets by his advice. And being a man of his hands,<a name="FNanchor_41_630" id="FNanchor_41_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_630" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
and a staunch upholder of the School-house, can't help
stopping to look on for a bit, and see Tom Brown, their
pet craftsman, fight a round.</p>

<p>It is grim earnest now, and no mistake. Both boys
feel this, and summon every power of head, hand, and eye
to their aid. A piece of luck on either side, a foot
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
slipping, a blow getting well home, or another fall may decide
it. Tom works slowly round for an opening; he has
all the legs and can choose his own time; the Slogger waits
for the attack, and hopes to finish it by some heavy right-handed
blow. As they quarter slowly over the ground,
the evening sun comes out from behind a cloud, and falls
full on Williams's face. Tom darts in, the heavy right-hand
is delivered, but only grazes his head. A short
rally at close quarters, and they close; in another moment
the Slogger is thrown again heavily for the third time.</p>

<p>"I'll give you three to two on the little one in half-crowns,"
said Groove to Rattle.</p>

<p>"No, thankee," answers the other, diving his hands
further into his coat-tails.</p>

<h4>THE DOCTOR ARRIVES.</h4>

<p>Just at this stage of the proceedings the door of the
turret<a name="FNanchor_42_631" id="FNanchor_42_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_631" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> which leads to the Doctor's library suddenly opens,
and he steps into the close, and makes straight for the
ring, in which Brown, and the Slogger were both seated
on their seconds' knees for the last time.</p>

<p>"The Doctor! the Doctor!" shouts one small boy who
catches sight of him, and the ring melts away in a few
seconds, the small boys tearing off, Tom collaring his
jacket and waistcoat, and slipping through the little gate
by the chapel, and round the corner to Harrowell's with
his backers, as lively as need be; Williams and his backers
making off not quite so fast across the close; Groove,
Rattle, and the other bigger fellows trying to combine
dignity and prudence in a comical manner, and walking
off fast enough, they hope, not to be recognized, and not
fast enough to look like running away.</p>

<p>Young Brooke alone remains on the ground by the time
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
the Doctor gets there, and touches his hat, not without a
slight inward qualm.</p>

<p>"Hah! Brooke. I am surprised to see you here. Don't
you know that I expect the sixth to stop fighting."</p>

<p>Brooke felt much more uncomfortable than he had expected,
but he was rather a favorite with the Doctor for
his openness and plainness of speech; so blurted out as
he walked by the Doctor's side, who had already turned
back:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, generally. But I thought you wished us to
exercise a discretion in the matter, too&mdash;not to interfere
too soon."</p>

<p>"But they have been fighting this half-hour and more,"
said the Doctor.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; but neither was hurt. And they're the sort
of boys who'll be all the better friends now, which they
wouldn't have been if they had been stopped any earlier&mdash;before
it was so equal."</p>

<p>"Who was fighting with Brown?" said the Doctor.</p>

<p>"Williams, sir, of Thompson's. He is bigger than
Brown, and had the best of it at first, but not when you
came up, Sir. There's a good deal of jealousy between
our house and Thompson's, and there would have been
more fights if this hadn't been let go on, or if either of
them had had much the worst of it."</p>

<p>"Well, but, Brooke," said the Doctor, "doesn't this
look a little as if you exercised your discretion by only
stopping a fight when the School-house boy is getting the
worst of it."</p>

<p>Brooke, it must be confessed, felt rather gravelled.<a name="FNanchor_43_632" id="FNanchor_43_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_632" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>
<p>"Now remember," added the Doctor, as he stopped at
the turret door, "this fight is not to go on&mdash;you'll see to
that. And I expect you to stop all fights in future at
once."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir," said young Brooke, touching his hat,
and not sorry to see the turret-door close behind the Doctor's
back.</p>

<h4>EVENING AFTER THE FIGHT.</h4>

<p>Meantime Tom and the staunchest of his adherents had
reached Harrowell's, and Sally was bustling about to get
them a late tea, while Stumps had been sent off to Tew,
the butcher, to get a piece of raw beef for Tom's eye,
which was to be healed off-hand, so that he might show
well in the morning. He was not a bit the worse except
a slight difficulty in his vision, a singing in his ears, and
a sprained thumb, which he kept in a cold water bandage,
while he drank lots of tea, and listened to the Babel of
voices talking and speculating of nothing but the fight,
and how Williams would have given in after another fall
(which he didn't in the least believe), and how on earth
the Doctor could have got to know of it&mdash;such bad luck!
He couldn't help thinking to himself that he was glad
he hadn't won; he liked it better as it was, and felt very
friendly to the Slogger. And then poor little Arthur
crept in and sat down quietly near him, looking at him
and the raw beef with such plaintive looks that Tom at
last burst out laughing.</p>

<p>"Don't make such eyes, young un," said he, "there's
nothing the matter."</p>

<p>"Oh, but, Tom, are you much hurt? I can't bear
thinking it was all for me."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it, don't flatter yourself. We were sure
to have it out, sooner or later."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span></p>
<p>"Well, but you won't go on, will you? You'll promise
me you won't go on?"</p>

<p>"Can't tell about that&mdash;all depends on the Houses.
We're in the hands of our countrymen, you know. Must
fight for the School-house flag, if so be."</p>

<p>However, the lovers of the science<a name="FNanchor_44_633" id="FNanchor_44_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_633" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> were doomed to disappointment
this time. Directly after locking-up, one of
the night-fags knocked at Tom's door.</p>

<p>"Brown, young Brooke wants you in the sixth-form
room."</p>

<h4>THE SHAKE-HANDS.</h4>

<p>Up went Tom to the summons, and found the magnates<a name="FNanchor_45_634" id="FNanchor_45_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_634" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
sitting at their supper.</p>

<p>"Well, Brown," said young Brooke, nodding to him,
"how do you feel?"</p>

<p>"Oh, very well, thank you; only I've sprained my
thumb, I think."</p>

<p>"Sure to do that in a fight. Well, you hadn't the
worst of it, I could see. Where did you learn that
throw?"</p>

<p>"Down in the country, when I was a boy."</p>

<p>"Hullo! why, what are you now? Well, never mind,
you're a plucky fellow. Sit down and have some supper."</p>

<p>Tom obeyed, by no means loath. He ate and drank,
listening to the pleasant talk, and wondering how soon he
should be in the fifth, and one of that much-envied society.</p>

<p>As he got up to leave, Brooke said: "You must shake
hands to-morrow morning; I shall come and see that done
after first lesson."</p>

<p>And so he did. And Tom and the Slogger shook
hands with great satisfaction and mutual respect. And
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
for the next year or two, whenever fights were being
talked of, the small boys who had been present shook
their heads wisely, saying: "Ah! but you should just
have seen the fight between Slogger Williams and Tom
Brown!"</p>

<h4>THE OLD BOY'S RULES.</h4>

<p>And now, boys all, three words before we quit the subject.
I have put in this chapter on fighting, of malice
prepense,<a name="FNanchor_46_635" id="FNanchor_46_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_635" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> partly because I want to give you a true picture
of what every-day school life was in my time, and not a
kid-glove and go-to-meeting-coat-picture; and partly because
of the cant<a name="FNanchor_47_636" id="FNanchor_47_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_636" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> and twaddle that's talked of boxing
and fighting with fists nowadays. Even Thackeray has
given in to it; and only a few weeks ago there was some
rampant stuff in the <i>Times</i> on the subject, in an article
on field sports.</p>

<p>Boys will quarrel, and when they quarrel will sometimes
fight. Fighting with fists is the natural and English way
for English boys to settle their quarrels. What substitute
for it is there, or ever was there, amongst any nation
under the sun? What would you like to see take its
place?</p>

<p>Learn to box, then, as you learn to play cricket and
foot-ball. Not one of you will be the worse, but very
much the better for learning to box well. Should you
never have to use it in earnest, there is no exercise in the
world so good for the temper, and for the muscles of the
back and legs.</p>

<p>As to fighting, keep out of it if you can by all means.
When the time comes, if it ever should, that you have to
say "Yes" or "No" to a challenge to fight, say "No"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
if you can,&mdash;only take care you make it clear to yourselves
why you say "No." It's a proof of the highest
courage, if done from true Christian motives. It's quite
right and justifiable, if done from a simple aversion to
physical pain and danger. But don't say "No" because
you fear a licking, and say or think it's because you fear
God, for that's neither Christian nor honest. And if you
do fight, fight it out; and don't give in while you can
stand and see.</p>

the last chapter, and the end of the summer half-year
is again drawing on. Martin has left and gone on a
cruise in the South Pacific in one of his uncle's ships; the
old magpie, as disreputable as ever, his last bequest<a name="FNanchor_1_637" id="FNanchor_1_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_637" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> to
Arthur, lives in the joint study. Arthur is nearly sixteen,
and at the head of the twenty, having gone up the school
at the rate of a form a half-year. East and Tom have
been much more deliberate in their progress, and are only
a little way up the fifth form. Great strapping boys they
are, but still thorough boys, filling about the same place
in the house that young Brooke filled when they were
new boys, and much the same sort of fellows. Constant
intercourse with Arthur has done much for both of them,
especially for Tom; but much remains yet to be done, if
they are to get all the good out of Rugby which is to be
got there in these times. Arthur is still frail and delicate,
with more spirit than body; but, thanks to his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
intimacy with them and Martin, has learned to swim, run,
and play cricket, and has never hurt himself by too much
reading.</p>

<h4>DEATH IN THE SCHOOL.</h4>

<p>One evening, as they were all sitting down to supper in
the fifth-form room, some one started a report that a fever
had broken out at one of the boarding-houses; "They
say," he added, "that Thompson is very ill, and that Dr.
Robertson has been sent for from Northampton."</p>

<p>"Then we shall all be sent home," cried another.
"Hurrah! five weeks' extra holidays, and no fifth-form
examination."</p>

<p>"I hope not," said Tom; " there'll be no Marylebone
match<a name="FNanchor_2_638" id="FNanchor_2_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_638" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> then at the end of the half."</p>

<p>Some thought one thing, some another; many didn't
believe the report; but the next day, Tuesday, Dr. Robertson
arrived, and stayed all day, and had long conferences
with the Doctor.</p>

<p>On Wednesday morning, after prayers, the Doctor addressed
the whole school. There were several cases of
fever in different houses, he said; but Dr. Robertson,
after the most careful examination, had assured him that
it was not infectious, and that if proper care were taken,
there could be no reason for stopping the school work
at present. The examinations were just coming on, and
it would be very unadvisable to break up now. However,
any boys who chose to do so were at liberty to write
home, and if their parents wished it, to leave at once.
He should send the whole school home if the fever spread.</p>

<p>The next day Arthur sickened, but there was no other
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
case. Before the end of the week thirty or forty boys had
gone, but the rest stayed on. There was a general wish
to please the Doctor, and a feeling that it was cowardly
to run away.</p>

<h4>THE DOCTOR'S SERMON.</h4>

<p>On the Saturday Thompson died, in the bright afternoon,
while the cricket-match was going on as usual on
the big-side ground: the Doctor coming from his death-bed,
passed along the gravel-walk at the side of the close, but
no one knew what had happened till the next day. At
morning lecture it began to be rumored, and by afternoon
chapel was known generally; and a feeling of seriousness
and awe at the actual presence of death among them came
over the whole school. In the long years of his ministry
the Doctor perhaps never spoke words which sank deeper
than some of those in that day's sermon. "When I came
yesterday from visiting all but the very death-bed of him
who has been taken from us, and looked around upon all
the familiar objects and scenes within our own ground,
where your common amusements were going on with
your common cheerfulness and activity, I felt there was
nothing painful in witnessing that; it did not seem in
any way shocking or out of tune with those feelings
which the sight of a dying Christian must be supposed to
awaken. The unsuitableness in point of natural feeling
between scenes of mourning and scenes of liveliness did
not at all present itself. But I did feel that if at that
moment any of those faults had been brought before me
which sometimes occur amongst us; had I heard that any
of you had been guilty of falsehood, or of drunkenness, or
of any other such sin; had I heard from any quarter the
language of profaneness, or of unkindness, or of indecency;
had I heard or seen any signs of that wretched
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
folly which courts the laugh of fools by affecting not to
dread evil and not to care for good, then the unsuitableness
of any of these things with the scene I had just
quitted would indeed have been most intensely painful.
And why? Not because such things would really have
been worse than at any other time, but because at such a
moment the eyes are opened really to know good and evil,
because we then feel what it is so to live that death becomes
an infinite blessing, and what it is so to live also,
that it were good for us if we had never been born."</p>

<p>Tom had gone into chapel in sickening anxiety about
Arthur, but he came out cheered and strengthened by
those grand words, and walked up alone to their study.
And when he sat down and looked round, and saw Arthur's
straw hat and cricket-jacket hanging on their
pegs, and marked all his neat little arrangements, not
one of which had been disturbed, the tears indeed rolled
down his cheeks; but they were calm and blessed tears,
and he repeated to himself, "Yes, Geordie's<a name="FNanchor_3_639" id="FNanchor_3_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_639" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> eyes are
opened&mdash;he knows what it is so to live that death becomes
an infinite blessing. But do I? O God, can I
bear to lose him?"</p>

<h4>ARTHUR'S ILLNESS.</h4>

<p>The week passed mournfully away. No more boys
sickened, but Arthur was reported worse each day, and his
mother arrived early in the week. Tom made many appeals
to be allowed to see him, and several times tried to
get up to the sick-room; but the housekeeper was always
in the way, and at last spoke to the Doctor, who kindly
but peremptorily forbade him.</p>

<p>Thompson was buried on the Tuesday; and the burial
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
service, so soothing and grand always, but beyond all
words solemn when read over a boy's grave to his companions,
brought Tom much comfort, and many strange
new thoughts and longings. He went back to his regular
life, and played cricket and bathed as usual; it seemed to
him that this was the right thing to do, and the new
thoughts and longings became more brave and healthy for
the effort. The crisis came on Saturday, the day week
that Thompson had died; and during that long afternoon
Tom sat in his study reading his Bible, and going every
half hour to the housekeeper's room, expecting each time
to hear that the gentle and brave little spirit had gone
home. But God had work for Arthur to do; the crisis
passed&mdash;on Sunday evening he was declared out of danger;
on Monday he sent a message to Tom that he was
almost well, had changed his room, and was to be allowed
to see him the next day.</p>

<p>It was evening when the housekeeper summoned him to
the sick-room. Arthur was lying on the sofa by the open
window, through which the rays of the western sun stole
gently, lighting up his white face and golden hair. Tom
remembered a German picture of an angel which he knew;
often had he thought how transparent and golden and
spirit-like it was; and he shuddered to think how like it
Arthur looked, and felt a shock as if his blood had all
stopped short, as he realized how near the other world his
friend must have been to look like that. Never till that
moment had he felt how his little chum had twined himself
round his heart-strings; and as he stole gently across
the room and knelt down, and put his arm round Arthur's
head on the pillow, he felt ashamed and half angry at his
own red and brown face, and the bounding sense of health
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
and power which filled every fibre of his body, and made
every movement of mere living a joy to him. He needn't
have troubled himself; it was this very strength and power
so different from his own which drew Arthur so to him.</p>

<p>Arthur laid his thin, white hand, on which the blue
veins stood out so plainly, on Tom's great brown fist, and
smiled at him, and then looked out of the window again,
as if he couldn't bear to lose a moment of the sunset, into
the tops of the great feathery elms, round which the rooks
were circling and clanging, returning in flocks from their
evening's foraging-parties. The elms rustled, the sparrows
in the ivy just outside the window chirped and
fluttered about, quarrelling, and making it up again; the
rooks, young and old, talked in chorus; and the merry
shouts of the boys, and the sweet click of cricket-bats,
came up cheerily from below.</p>

<h4>CONVALESCENCE.</h4>

<p>"Dear George," said Tom, "I am so glad to be let up
to see you at last. I've tried hard to come so often, but
they wouldn't let me before."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know, Tom; Mary has told me every day about
you, and how she was obliged to make the Doctor speak
to you to keep you away. I'm very glad you didn't get
up, for you might have caught it, and you couldn't stand
being ill with all the matches going on. And you're in
the eleven, too, I hear&mdash;I'm so glad."</p>

<p>"Yes, isn't it jolly?" said Tom, proudly; "I'm ninth,
too. I made forty at the last pie-match,<a name="FNanchor_4_640" id="FNanchor_4_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_640" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and caught three
fellows out. So I was put in above Jones and Tucker.
Tucker's so savage, for he was head of the twenty-two."</p>

<p>"Well, I think you ought to be higher yet," said Arthur,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
who was as jealous for the renown of Tom in games, as Tom
was for his as a scholar.</p>

<p>"Never mind, I don't care about cricket or anything
now you are getting well, Geordie; and I shouldn't have
hurt, I know, if they'd have let me come up,&mdash;nothing
hurts me. But you'll get about now, directly, won't you?
You won't believe how clean I've kept the study. All
your things are just as you left them; and I feed the old
magpie just when you used, though I have to come in
from big-side for him, the old rip. He won't look pleased
all I can do, and sticks his head first on one side and then
on the other, and blinks at me before he'll begin to eat,
till I'm half inclined to box his ears. And whenever East
comes in you should see him hop off to the window, dot
and go one,<a name="FNanchor_5_641" id="FNanchor_5_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_641" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> though Harry wouldn't touch a feather of
him now."</p>

<p>Arthur laughed. "Old Gravey has a good memory;
he can't forget the sieges of poor Martin's den in old
times." He paused a moment and then went on. "You
can't think how often I've been thinking of old Martin
since I've been ill; I suppose one's mind gets restless, and
likes to wander off to strange, unknown places. I wonder
what queer new pets the old boy has got; how he must be
revelling in the thousand new birds, beasts, and fishes."</p>

<p>Tom felt a pang of jealousy, but kicked it out in a
moment. "Fancy him on a South-sea island, with the
Cherokees or Patagonians, or some such wild niggers"
(Tom's ethnology<a name="FNanchor_6_642" id="FNanchor_6_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_642" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and geography were faulty, but sufficient
for his needs); "they'll make the old Madman cock
medicine-man<a name="FNanchor_7_643" id="FNanchor_7_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_643" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and tattoo him all over. Perhaps he's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
cutting about now all blue, and has a squaw and a wigwam.
He'll improve their boomerangs,<a name="FNanchor_8_644" id="FNanchor_8_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_644" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and be able to throw
them, too, without having old Thomas sent after him by
the Doctor to take them away."</p>

<h4>MEMORIES.</h4>

<p>Arthur laughed at the remembrance of the boomerang
story, but then looked grave again, and said: "He'll convert
all the island, I know."</p>

<p>"Yes, if he doesn't blow it up first."</p>

<p>"Do you remember, Tom, how you and East used to
laugh at him and chaff him, because he said he was sure
the rooks all had calling-over or prayers, or something of
that sort, when the locking-up bell rang? Well, I declare,"
said Arthur, looking up seriously into Tom's laughing
eyes, "I do think he was right. Since I've been
lying here, I've watched them every night; and do you
know, they really do come and perch, all of them, just
about locking-up time; and then first there's a regular
chorus of caws, and then they stop a bit, and one old fellow,
or perhaps two or three in different trees, caw solos,
and then off they all go again, fluttering about and cawing
anyhow till they roost."</p>

<p>"I wonder if the old blackies<a name="FNanchor_9_645" id="FNanchor_9_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_645" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> do talk," said Tom, looking
up at them. "How they must abuse me and East,
and pray for the Doctor for stopping the singing!"</p>

<p>"There! look, look!" cried Arthur, "don't you see the
old fellow without a tail coming up? Martin used to call
him the 'clerk.'<a name="FNanchor_10_646" id="FNanchor_10_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_646" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> He can't steer himself. You never saw
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
such fun as he is in a high wind, when he can't steer himself
home, and gets carried right past the trees, and has
to bear up again and again before he can perch."</p>

<p>The locking-up bell began to toll, and the two boys
were silent, and listened to it. The sound soon carried
Tom off to the river and the woods, and he began to go
over in his mind the many occasions on which he had
heard that toll coming faintly down the breeze, and had
to pack his rod in a hurry, and make a run for it, to get
in before the gates were shut. He was aroused with a
start from his memories by Arthur's voice, gentle and
weak from his late illness.</p>

<p>"Tom, will you be angry if I talk to you very seriously?"</p>

<p>"No, dear old boy, not I, but aren't you faint, Arthur, or
ill? What can I get you? Don't say anything to hurt
yourself now&mdash;you are very weak; let me come up again."</p>

<p>"No, no, I sha'n't hurt myself; I'd sooner speak to you
now, if you don't mind. I've asked Mary to tell the Doctor
that you are with me, so you needn't go down to calling-over;
and I mayn't have another chance, for I shall
most likely have to go home for change of air to get well,
and mayn't come back this half."</p>

<p>"Oh, do you think you must go away before the end of
the half? I'm so sorry. It's more than five weeks yet to
the holidays, and all the fifth-form examinations, and half
the cricket-matches to come yet. And what shall I do all
that time alone in our study? Why, Arthur, it will be
more than twelve weeks before I see you again. Oh, hang
it, I can't stand that! Besides, who's to keep me up to
working at the examination-books? I shall come out bottom
of the form, as sure as eggs is eggs."</p>

<h4>MORE LESSONS.</h4>

<p>Tom was rattling on, half in joke, half in earnest, for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
he wanted to get Arthur out of his serious vein, thinking
it would do him harm; but Arthur broke in:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, please, Tom, stop, or you'll drive all I had to say
out of my head. And I'm already horribly afraid I'm
going to make you angry."</p>

<p>"Don't gammon,<a name="FNanchor_11_647" id="FNanchor_11_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_647" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> young un," rejoined Tom (the use of
the old name, dear to him from old recollections, made
Arthur start and smile, and feel quite happy); "you
know you aren't afraid, and you've never made me angry
since the first month we chummed together. Now I'm
going to be quite sober for a quarter of an hour, which is
more than I am once in a year; so make the most of it;
heave ahead, and pitch into me right and left."</p>

<p>"Dear Tom, I'm not going to pitch into you," said
Arthur, piteously; "and it seems so cocky in me to be
advising you, who've been my back-bone ever since I've
been at Rugby, and have made the school a paradise to
me. Ah, I see I shall never do it, unless I go head-over-heels
at once, as you said when you taught me to swim.
Tom, I want you to give up using Vulgus-books and
cribs."<a name="FNanchor_12_648" id="FNanchor_12_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_648" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Arthur sank back on to his pillow with a sigh, as if the
effort had been great; but the worst was now over, and he
looked straight at Tom, who was evidently taken aback.
He leant his elbows on his knees, and stuck his hands into
his hair, whistled a verse of "Billie Taylor," and then was
quite silent for another minute. Not a shade crossed his
face, but he was clearly puzzled. At last he looked up,
and caught Arthur's anxious look, took his hand, and said
simply:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why, young un?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span></p>
<p>"Because you're the honestest boy in Rugby, and that
isn't honest."</p>

<p>"I don't see that."</p>

<p>"What were you sent to Rugby for?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know exactly&mdash;nobody ever told me.
I suppose because all boys are sent to a public-school in
England."</p>

<p>"But what do you think yourself? What do you want
to do here and to carry away?"</p>

<p>Tom thought a minute. "I want to be A 1 at cricket
and foot-ball, and all the other games, and to make my
hands keep my head against any fellow, lout or gentleman.
I want to get into the sixth before I leave, and to please
the Doctor; and I want to carry away just as much Latin
and Greek as will take me through Oxford respectably.
There now, young un, I never thought of it before, but
that's pretty much about my figure. Isn't it all on the
square? What have you got to say to that?"</p>

<p>"Why, that you are pretty sure to do all that you want,
then."</p>

<p>"Well, I hope so. But you've forgot one thing, what I
want to leave behind me. I want to leave behind me,"
said Tom, speaking slow, and looking much moved, "the
name of a fellow who never bullied a little boy, or turned
his back on a big one."</p>

<p>Arthur pressed his hand, and after a moment's silence
went on: "You say, Tom, you want to please the Doctor.
Now, do you want to please him by what he thinks you
do, or by what you really do?"</p>

<p>"By what I really do, of course."</p>

<p>"Does he think you use cribs and Vulgus-books?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span></p>
<p>Tom felt at once that his flank was turned,<a name="FNanchor_13_649" id="FNanchor_13_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_649" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> but he
couldn't give in. "He was at Winchester himself," said
he; "he knows all about it."</p>

<p>"Yes, but does he think <i>you</i> use them? Do you think
he approves of it?"</p>

<p>"You young villain!" said Tom, shaking his fist at
Arthur, half vexed and half pleased. "I never think
about it. Hang it&mdash;there, perhaps he doesn't. Well, I
suppose he doesn't."</p>

<h4>TOM'S CONFESSIONS.</h4>

<p>Arthur saw that he had got his point; he knew his
friend well, and was wise in silence as in speech. He
only said, "I would sooner have the Doctor's good opinion
of me as I really am than any man's in the world."</p>

<p>After another minute, Tom began again; "Look here,
young un, how on earth am I to get time to play the
matches this half, if I give up cribs? We're in the middle
of that long crabbed chorus in the Agamemnon;<a name="FNanchor_14_650" id="FNanchor_14_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_650" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> I can
only just make head or tail of it with the crib. Then
there's Pericles' speech coming on in Thucydides, and 'The
Birds' to get up for the examination, besides the Tacitus."
Tom groaned at the thought of his accumulated labors.
"I say, young un, there's only five weeks or so left to
the holidays; mayn't I go on as usual for this half? I'll
tell the Doctor about it some day, or you may."</p>

<p>Arthur looked out of the window; the twilight had
come on, and all was silent. He repeated, in a low voice,
"In this thing the Lord pardon thy servant, that when
my master goeth into the house of Rimmon, to worship
there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I bow down
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
myself in the house of Rimmon, when I bow down myself in
the house of Rimmon, the Lord pardon thy servant in this
thing."<a name="FNanchor_15_651" id="FNanchor_15_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_651" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Not a word more was said on the subject, and the boys
were again silent,&mdash;one of those blessed, short silences in
which the resolves which color a life are so often taken.</p>

<h4>TOM OUT-GENERALLED.</h4>

<p>Tom was the first to break it. "You've been very ill
indeed, haven't you, Geordie?" said he, with a mixture
of awe and curiosity, feeling as if his friend had been in
some strange place or scene, of which he could form no
idea, and full of the memory of his own thoughts during
the last week.</p>

<p>"Yes, very. I'm sure the Doctor thought I was going
to die. He gave me the Sacrament last Sunday, and you
can't think what he is when one is ill. He said such brave,
and tender, and gentle things to me, I felt quite light and
strong after it, and never had any more fear. My mother
brought our old medical man, who attended me when I
was a poor sickly child; he said my constitution was quite
changed, and that I'm fit for anything now. If it hadn't,
I couldn't have stood three days of this illness. That's
all, thanks to you, and the games you've made me fond
of."</p>

<p>"More thanks to old Martin," said Tom; "he's been
your real friend."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Tom; he never could have done for me
what you have."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know; I did little enough. Did they tell
you&mdash;you won't mind hearing it now, I know&mdash;that poor
Thompson died last week? The other three boys are
getting quite round, like you."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span></p>
<p>"Oh, yes, I heard of it."</p>

<p>Then Tom, who was quite full of it, told Arthur of the
burial service in the chapel, and how it had impressed him
and, he believed, all the other boys. "And though the
Doctor never said a word about it," said he, "and it was
a half-holiday and match day, there wasn't a game played
in the close all the afternoon, and the boys all went about
as if it were Sunday."</p>

<p>"I'm very glad of it," said Arthur. "But, Tom, I've
had such strange thoughts about death lately. I've never
told a soul of them, not even my mother. Sometimes I
think they're wrong, but, do you know, I don't think in my
heart I could be sorry at the death of any of my friends."</p>

<p>Tom was taken quite aback. "What in the world is
the young un after now?" thought he; "I've swallowed a
good many of his crotchets, but this altogether beats me.
He can't be quite right in his head." He didn't want to
say a word, and shifted about uneasily in the dark; however,
Arthur seemed to be waiting for an answer, so at
last he said: "I don't think I quite see what you mean,
Geordie. One's told so often to think about death, that
I've tried it on sometimes, especially this last week. But
we won't talk of it now. I'd better go&mdash;you're getting
tired, and I shall do you harm."</p>

<p>"No, no, indeed I'm not, Tom; you must stop till nine,
there's only twenty minutes. I've settled you shall stop
till nine. And oh! do let me talk to you&mdash;I must talk to
you. I see it's just as I feared. You think I'm half mad,
don't you now?"</p>

<p>"Well, I did think it odd what you said, Geordie, as
you ask me."</p>

<h4>ARTHUR'S FEVER.</h4>

<p>Arthur paused a moment, and then said quickly, "I'll
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
tell you how it all happened. At first, when I was sent
to the sick-room, and found that I had really got the fever,
I was terribly frightened. I thought I should die, and I
could not face it for a moment. I don't think it was
sheer cowardice at first, but I thought how hard it was to
be taken away from my mother and sisters, and you all,
just as I was beginning to see my way to many things, and
to feel that I might be a man, and do a man's work. To
die without having fought, and worked, and given one's
life away, was too hard to bear. I got terribly impatient,
and accused God of injustice, and strove to justify myself;
and the harder I strove the deeper I sank. Then the
image of my dear father often came across me, but I
turned from it. Whenever it came, a heavy numbing
throb seemed to take hold of my heart, and say, 'Dead&mdash;dead&mdash;dead.'
And I cried out, 'The living, the living
shall praise Thee O God; the dead cannot praise Thee.<a name="FNanchor_16_652" id="FNanchor_16_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_652" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
There is no work in the grave;<a name="FNanchor_17_653" id="FNanchor_17_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_653" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> in the night no man can
work. But I can work. I can do great things. I <i>will</i>
do great things. Why wilt thou slay me?' And so I
struggled and plunged, deeper and deeper, and went down
into a living black tomb. I was alone there, with no
power to stir or think; alone with myself; beyond the
reach of all human fellowship; beyond Christ's reach, I
thought, in my nightmare. You, who are brave and
bright and strong, can have no idea of that agony, pray to
God you never may. Pray as for your life."</p>

<p>Arthur stopped&mdash;from exhaustion, Tom thought; but
what between his fear lest Arthur should hurt himself,
his awe, and longing for him to go on, he couldn't ask, or
stir to help him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span></p>
<h4>ARTHUR'S VISION.</h4>

<p>Presently he went on, but quite calm and slow. "I
don't know how long. I was in that state. For more than
a day, I know; for I was quite conscious, and lived my
outer life all the time, and took my medicines, and spoke
to my mother, and heard what they said. But I didn't
take much note of time; I thought time was over for me,
and that that tomb was what was beyond. Well, on last
Sunday morning, as I seemed to lie in that tomb, alone,
as I thought, forever and ever, the black dead wall was
cleft in two, and I was caught up and borne into the light
by some great power, some living mighty spirit. Tom,
do you remember the living creatures and the wheels in
Ezekiel?<a name="FNanchor_18_654" id="FNanchor_18_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_654" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> It was just like that: 'When they went, I heard
the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters,
as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the
noise of an host; when they stood, they let down their
wings'&mdash;'and they went every one straight forward;&mdash;whither
the spirit was to go they went, and they turned
not when they went.' And we rushed through the bright
air, which was full of myriads of living creatures, and
paused on the brink of a great river. And the power held
me up, and I knew that that great river was the grave,
and death dwelt there; but not the death I had met in
the black tomb,&mdash;that I felt was gone forever. For on
the other bank of the great river I saw men and women
and children rising up pure and bright, and the tears
were wiped from their eyes, and they put on glory and
strength, and all weariness and pain fell away. And
beyond were a multitude which no man could number,
and they worked at some great work; and they who
rose from the river went on and joined in the work. They
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
all worked, and each worked in a different way,
but all at the same work. And I saw there my father,
and the men in the old town whom I knew when I was a
child; many a hard stern man, who never came to church,
and whom they called atheist and infidel. There they
were, side by side with my father, whom I had seen toil
and die for them, and women and little children, and the
seal<a name="FNanchor_19_655" id="FNanchor_19_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_655" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> was on the foreheads of all. And I longed to see
what the work was, and could not; so I tried to plunge
into the river, for I thought I would join them, but I
could not. Then I looked about to see how they got into
the river. And this I could not see, but I saw myriads
on this side, and they too worked, and I knew that it was
the same work; and the same seal was on their foreheads.
And though I saw that there was toil and anguish in the
work of these, and that most that were working were
blind and feeble, yet I longed no more to plunge into the
river, but more and more to know what the work was.
And as I looked I saw my mother and my sisters, and I
saw the Doctor, and you, Tom, and hundreds more whom
I knew. And at last I saw myself, too, and I was toiling
and doing ever so little a piece of the great work. Then
it all melted away, and the power left me, and as it left
me I thought I heard a voice say: 'The vision is for an
appointed time; though it tarry, wait for it, for in the
end it shall speak and not lie, it shall surely come, it shall
not tarry.'<a name="FNanchor_20_656" id="FNanchor_20_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_656" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> It was early morning I know then, it was so
quiet and cool, and my mother was fast asleep in the
chair by my bedside; but it wasn't only a dream of mine.
I know it wasn't a dream. Then I fell into a deep sleep,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
and only woke after afternoon chapel; and the Doctor
came and gave me the Sacrament as I told you. I told
him and my mother I should get well&mdash;I knew I should;
but I couldn't tell them why. Tom," said Arthur, gently,
after another minute, "do you see why I could not grieve
now to see my dearest friend die? It can't be&mdash;it isn't
all fever or illness. God would never have let me see it
so clear if it wasn't true. I don't understand it all yet&mdash;it
will take me my life, and longer, to do that&mdash;to find
out what the work is."</p>

<h4>ARTHUR'S MOTHER.</h4>

<p>When Arthur stopped, there was a long pause. Tom
could not speak; he was almost afraid to breathe, lest he
should break the train of Arthur's thoughts. He longed
to hear more, and to ask questions. In another minute
nine o'clock struck, and a gentle tap at the door called
them both back into the world again. They did not answer,
however, for a moment, and so the door opened and
a lady came in, carrying a candle.</p>

<p>She went straight to the sofa, and took hold of Arthur's
hand, and then stooped down and kissed him.</p>

<p>"My dearest boy, you feel a little feverish again. Why
didn't you have lights? You've talked too much, and excited
yourself in the dark."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, mother, you can't think how well I feel. I
shall start with you to-morrow for Devonshire. But,
mother, here's my friend, here's Tom Brown&mdash;you know
him?"</p>

<p>"Yes indeed, I've known him for years," she said, and
held out her hand to Tom, who was now standing up behind
the sofa. This was Arthur's mother; tall, and slight,
and fair, with masses of golden hair drawn back from the
broad white forehead, and the calm blue eye meeting his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
so deep and open,&mdash;the eye that he knew so well, for it
was his friend's over again, and the lovely tender mouth
that trembled while he looked. She stood there a woman
of thirty-eight, old enough to be his mother, and one
whose face showed the lines that must be written on the
faces of good men's wives and widows,&mdash;but he thought
he had never seen anything so beautiful. He couldn't
help wondering if Arthur's sisters were like her.</p>

<p>Tom held her hand, and looked her straight in the face;
he could neither let it go nor speak.</p>

<p>"Now, Tom," said Arthur, laughing, "where are your
manners? You'll stare my mother out of countenance."
Tom dropped the little hand with a sigh. "There, sit
down, both of you. Here, dearest mother, there's room
here," and he made a place on the sofa for her. "Tom,
you needn't go; I'm sure you won't be called up at first
lesson." Tom felt that he would risk being floored at
every lesson for the rest of his natural school-life sooner
than go; so sat down. "And now," said Arthur, "I have
realized one of the dearest wishes of my life,&mdash;to see you
two together."</p>

<h4>TOM'S REWARDS.</h4>

<p>And then he led away the talk to their home in Devonshire,
and the red bright earth, and the deep green combes,<a name="FNanchor_21_657" id="FNanchor_21_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_657" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
and the peat<a name="FNanchor_22_658" id="FNanchor_22_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_658" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> streams like cairngorm<a name="FNanchor_23_659" id="FNanchor_23_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_659" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> pebbles, and the
wild moor<a name="FNanchor_24_660" id="FNanchor_24_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_660" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> with its high cloudy Tors<a name="FNanchor_25_661" id="FNanchor_25_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_661" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> for a giant background
to the picture,&mdash;till Tom got jealous, and stood
up for the clear chalk streams, and the emerald water
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
meadows and great elms and willows of the dear old
Royal county, as he gloried to call it. And the mother
sat on quiet and loving, rejoicing in their life. The
quarter-to-ten struck, and the bell rang for bed, before
they had well begun their talk as it seemed.</p>

<p>Then Tom rose with a sigh to go.</p>

<p>"Shall I see you in the morning, Geordie?" said he, as
he shook his friend's hand. "Never mind, though; you'll
be back next half, and I sha'n't forget the house of
Rimmon."</p>

<p>Arthur's mother got up and walked with him to the
door, and there gave him her hand again, and again his
eyes met that deep loving look, which was like a spell
upon him. Her voice trembled slightly as she said,
"Good-night,&mdash;you are one who knows what our Father
has promised to the friend of the widow and the fatherless.
May He deal with you as you have dealt with me
and mine!"</p>

<p>Tom was quite upset; he mumbled something about
owing everything good in him to Geordie&mdash;looked in her
face again, pressed her hand to his lips, and rushed down
stairs to his study, where he sat till old Thomas came
kicking at the door to tell him his allowance<a name="FNanchor_26_662" id="FNanchor_26_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_662" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> would be
stopped if he didn't go off to bed. (It would have been
stopped anyhow, but that he was a great favorite with
the old gentleman, who loved to come out in the afternoon
into the close to Tom's wicket, and bowl slow twisters<a name="FNanchor_27_663" id="FNanchor_27_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_663" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
to him, and talk of the glories of bygone Surrey<a name="FNanchor_28_664" id="FNanchor_28_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_664" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
heroes, with whom he had played in former generations.)</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
So Tom roused himself, and took up his candle to go to
bed; and then for the first time was aware of a beautiful
new fishing-rod, with old Eton's<a name="FNanchor_29_665" id="FNanchor_29_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_665" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> mark on it, and a splendidly
bound Bible, which lay on his table, on the title-page
of which was written: "<span class="smcap">Tom Brown</span>, from his
affectionate and grateful friends, Frances Jane Arthur;
George Arthur."</p>

<p>I leave you all to guess how he slept, and what he
dreamt of.</p>

<h4>TOM SPRINGS HIS MINE.</h4>

<p>The next morning, after breakfast, Tom, East, and
Gower met as usual to learn their second lessons
together. Tom had been considering how to break his
proposal of giving up the crib to the others, and having
found no better way (as indeed none better can ever be
found by man or boy), told them simply what had happened;
how he had been to see Arthur, who had talked
to him upon the subject, and what he had said; and for
his part he had made up his mind, and wasn't going to
use cribs any more; and being quite sure of his ground,
took the high and pathetic tone, and was proceeding to
say, "how, that, having learned his lessons with them for
so many years, it would grieve him much to put an end to
the arrangement, and he hoped at any rate that, if they
wouldn't go on with him, they should still be just as good
friends, and respect one another's motives&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here the other boys, who had been listening with open
eyes and ears, burst in:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
"Stuff and nonsense!" cried Gower. " Here, East, get
down the crib and find the place."</p>

<p>"Oh, Tommy, Tommy!" said East, proceeding to do as
he was bidden, "that it should ever have come to this. I
knew Arthur'd be the ruin of you some day, and you of
me. And now the time's come"&mdash;and he made a doleful
face.</p>

<p>"I don't know about ruin," answered Tom; "I know
that you and I would have had the sack<a name="FNanchor_1_666" id="FNanchor_1_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_666" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> long ago, if it
hadn't been for him. And you know it as well as I."</p>

<p>"Well, we were in a baddish way before he came, I
own; but this new crotchet of his is past a joke."</p>

<p>"Let's give it a trial, Harry; come&mdash;you know how
often he has been right and we wrong."</p>

<p>"Now, don't you two be jawing away about young
Squaretoes,"<a name="FNanchor_2_667" id="FNanchor_2_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_667" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> struck in Gower. "He's no end of a sucking
wiseacre,<a name="FNanchor_3_668" id="FNanchor_3_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_668" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> I dare say, but we've no time to lose, and I've
got the fives'-court at half-past nine."</p>

<p>"I say, Gower," said Tom, appealingly, "be a good
fellow, and let's try if we can't get on without the crib."</p>

<p>"What! in this chorus?<a name="FNanchor_4_669" id="FNanchor_4_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_669" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Why, we sha'n't get through
ten lines."</p>

<p>"I say, Tom," cried East, having hit on a new idea,
"don't you remember, when we were in the upper fourth,
and old Momus<a name="FNanchor_5_670" id="FNanchor_5_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_670" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> caught me construing off the leaf of
a crib which I'd torn out and put in my book, and which
would float out on to the floor, he sent me up to be flogged
for it?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span></p>
<p>"Yes, I remember it very well."</p>

<p>"Well, the Doctor, after he'd flogged me, told me himself
that he didn't flog me for using a translation, but for
taking it into lesson, and using it there, when I hadn't
learnt a word before I came in. He said there was no
harm in using a translation to get a clew to hard passages,
if you tried all you could first to make them out without."</p>

<p>"Did he, though?" said Tom, "then Arthur must be
wrong."</p>

<p>"Of course he is," said Gower, "the little prig! We'll
only use the crib when we can't construe without it. Go
ahead, East."</p>

<h4>RESULTS OF THE EXPLOSION.</h4>

<p>And on this agreement they started: Tom, satisfied with
having made this confession, and not sorry to have a <i>locus
penitenti&aelig;</i>,<a name="FNanchor_6_671" id="FNanchor_6_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_671" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and not to be deprived altogether of the use of
his old and faithful friend.</p>

<p>The boys went on as usual, each taking a sentence in
turn, and the crib being handed to the one whose turn it
was to construe. Of course Tom couldn't object to this,
as was it not simply lying there to be appealed to in case
the sentence should prove too hard altogether for the construer?
But it must be owned that Gower and East did
not make very tremendous exertions to conquer their sentences
before having recourse to its help. Tom, however,
with the most heroic virtue and gallantry rushed into his
sentence, searching in a high-minded manner for nominative
and verb, and turning over his dictionary frantically
for the first hard word that stopped him. But in the
meantime Gower, who was bent on getting to fives, would
peep quietly into the crib, and then suggest, "Don't you
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
think this is the meaning?" "I think you must take it
this way, Brown;" and as Tom didn't see his way to not
profiting by these suggestions, the lesson went on about as
quickly as usual, and Gower was able to start for fives'-court
within five minutes of the half-hour.</p>

<p>When Tom and East were left face to face, they looked
at one another for a minute, Tom puzzled and East chock-full
of fun, and then burst into a roar of laughter.</p>

<h4>THE ENEMY'S DEFENCE.</h4>

<p>"Well, Tom," said East, recovering himself, "I don't
see any objection to the new way. It's about as good as
the old one, I think; besides the advantage it gives one
of feeling virtuous, and looking down on one's neighbors."</p>

<p>Tom shoved his hand into his back hair. "I'm not so
sure," said he; "you two fellows carried me off my legs;
I don't really think we tried one sentence fairly. Are
you sure you remember what the Doctor said to you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. And I'll swear I couldn't make out one of my
sentences to-day. No, nor ever could. I really don't
remember," said East, speaking slowly and impressively,
"to have come across one Latin or Greek sentence this
half that I could go and construe by the light of nature.
Whereby I am sure Providence intended cribs to be used."</p>

<p>"The thing to find out," said Tom, meditatively, "is
how long one ought to grind at a sentence without looking
at the crib. Now, I think, if one fairly looks out all
the words one doesn't know, and then can't hit it, that's
enough."</p>

<p>"To be sure, Tommy," said East, demurely, but with a
merry twinkle in his eye. "Your new doctrine, too, old
fellow," added he, "when one comes to think of it, is a
cutting at the root of all school morality. You'll take
away mutual help, brotherly love, or, in the vulgar tongue,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
'giving construes,' which I hold to be one of our highest
virtues. For how can you distinguish between getting a
construe from another boy and using a crib? Hang it,
Tom, if you're going to deprive all our school-fellows of
the chance of exercising Christian benevolence and being
good Samaritans, I shall cut the concern."</p>

<p>"I wish you wouldn't joke about it, Harry. It's hard
enough to see one's way, a precious sight harder than I
thought last night. But I suppose there's a use and an
abuse of both, and one'll get straight enough somehow.
But you can't make out anyhow that one has a right to
use old Vulgus-books and copy-books."</p>

<p>"Hullo, more heresy! How fast a fellow goes down
hill when once he gets his head before his legs! Listen
to me, Tom. Not use old Vulgus-books! Why, you
Goth,<a name="FNanchor_7_672" id="FNanchor_7_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_672" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> aren't we to take the benefit of the wisdom, and
admire and use the work of past generations? Not use
old copy-books! Why, you might as well say we ought to
pull down Westminster Abbey, and put up a go-to-meeting-shop
with churchwarden windows;<a name="FNanchor_8_673" id="FNanchor_8_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_673" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> or never read
Shakespeare, but only Sheridan Knowles.<a name="FNanchor_9_674" id="FNanchor_9_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_674" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Think of all
the work and labor that our predecessors have bestowed
on these very books, and are we to make their work of no
value?"</p>

<p>"I say, Harry, please don't chaff; I'm really serious."</p>

<p>"And, then, is it not our duty to consult the pleasure
of others rather than our own; and, above all, that of our
masters? Fancy, then, the difference to them in looking
over a Vulgus which has been carefully touched and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
retouched by themselves and others, and which must bring
them a sort of dreamy pleasure, as if they'd met the
thought or expression of it somewhere or another,&mdash;before
they were born, perhaps,&mdash;and that of cutting up, and making
picture-frames round all your and my false quantities
and other monstrosities. Why, Tom, you wouldn't be so
cruel as never to let old Momus hum over the 'O genus
humanum' again, and then look up doubtingly through
his spectacles, and end by smiling and giving three extra
marks for it; just for old sake's sake, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Well," said Tom, getting up in something as like a
huff as he was capable of, "it's deuced hard that when a
fellow's really trying to do what he ought, his best friends'll
do nothing but chaff him and try to put him down." And
he stuck his books under his arm, and his hat on his head,
preparatory to rushing out into the quadrangle, to testify
with his own soul of the faithlessness of friendships.</p>

<p>"Now don't be an ass, Tom," said East, catching hold
of him; "you know me well enough by this time; my
bark's worse than my bite. You can't expect to ride your
new crotchet without anybody's trying to make him kick
you off: especially as we shall have to go on foot still.
But now sit down, and let's go over it again. I'll be as
serious as a judge."</p>

<p>Then Tom sat himself down on the table, and waxed
eloquent about all the righteousness and advantages of the
new plan, as was his wont whenever he took up anything;
going into it as if his life depended upon it, and sparing
no abuse which he could think of, of the opposite method,
which he denounced as ungentlemanly, cowardly, mean,
lying, and no one knows what besides. "Very cool of
Tom," as East thought, but didn't say, "seeing as how
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
he only came out of Egypt<a name="FNanchor_10_675" id="FNanchor_10_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_675" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> himself last night at bed-time."</p>

<p>"Well, Tom," said he, at last, "you see, when you and I
came to school there were none of these sort of notions.
You may be right&mdash;I dare say you are. Only what one
has always felt about the masters is that it's a fair trial of
skill and last<a name="FNanchor_11_676" id="FNanchor_11_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_676" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> between us and them&mdash;like a match at foot-ball,
or a battle. We're natural enemies in school, that's
the fact. We've got to learn so much Latin and Greek
and do so many verses, and they've got to see that we do
it. If we can slip the collar, and do so much less without
getting caught, that's one to us. If they can get more out
of us, or catch us shirking, that's one to them. All's fair
in war, but lying. If I run my luck against theirs, and go
into school without looking at my lessons, and don't get
called up, why am I a snob<a name="FNanchor_12_677" id="FNanchor_12_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_677" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> or a sneak? I don't tell the
master I've learnt it. He's got to find out whether I have
or not; what's he paid for? If he calls me up, and I get
floored, he makes me write it out in Greek and English.
Very good; he's caught me, and I don't grumble. I grant
you, if I go and snivel to him, and tell him I've really tried
to learn it, but found it so hard without a translation, or
say I've had a toothache, or any humbug of that kind, I'm
a snob. That's my school morality; it's served me, and
you too, Tom, for the matter of that, these five years.
And it's all clear and fair, no mistake about it. We
understand it, and they understand it, and I don't know
what we're to come to with any other."</p>

<h4>THE TRUCE.</h4>

<p>Tom looked at him pleased, and a little puzzled. He
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
had never heard East speak his mind seriously before, and
couldn't help feeling how completely he had hit his own
theory and practice up to that time.</p>

<p>"Thank you, old fellow," said he. "You're a good
old brick to be serious and not put out with me. I said
more than I meant, I dare say, only you see I know I'm
right; whatever you and Gower and the rest do, I shall
hold on&mdash;I must. And as it's all new and an up-hill game,
you see, one must hit hard and hold on tight at first."</p>

<p>"Very good," said East; "hold on and hit away, only
don't hit under the line."<a name="FNanchor_13_678" id="FNanchor_13_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_678" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>"But I must bring you over, Harry, or I sha'n't be
comfortable. Now, I'll allow all you've said. We've
always been honorable enemies with the masters. We
found a state of war when we came, and went into it of
course. Only don't you think things are altered a good
deal? I don't feel as I used to the masters. They seem
to me to treat one quite differently."</p>

<p>"Yes, perhaps they do," said East; "there's a new set,
you see, mostly, who don't feel sure of themselves yet.
They don't want to fight till they know the ground."</p>

<p>"I don't think it's only that," said Tom. "And then
the Doctor, he does treat one so openly, and like a
gentleman, and as if one was working with him."</p>

<p>"Well, so he does," said East; "he's a splendid fellow,
and when I get into the sixth I shall act accordingly.
Only you know he has nothing to do with our lessons
now, except examining us. I say, though, "looking at
his watch, "it's just the quarter. Come along."</p>

<h4>ARTHUR GOES HOME.</h4>

<p>As they walked out they got a message, to say "that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
Arthur was just starting and would like to say good-bye";
so they went down to the private entrance of the
School-house, and found an open carriage, with Arthur
propped up with pillows in it, looking already better, Tom
thought.</p>

<p>They jumped up on to the steps to shake hands with
him, and Tom mumbled thanks for the presents he had
found in his study, and looked round anxiously for
Arthur's mother.</p>

<p>East, who had fallen back into his usual humor, looked
quaintly at Arthur, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"So you've been at it again, through that hot-headed
convert of yours there. He's been making our lives a
burden to us all the morning about using cribs. I shall
get floored to a certainty at second lesson, if I'm called up."</p>

<p>Arthur blushed and looked down. Tom struck in:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, it's all right. He's converted already; he always
comes through the mud, after us, grumbling and spluttering."</p>

<p>The clock struck, and they had to go off to school,
wishing Arthur a pleasant holiday, Tom lingering behind
a moment to send his thanks and love to Arthur's
mother.</p>

<h4>THE SIEGE REOPENS.</h4>

<p>Tom renewed the discussion after second lesson, and
succeeded so far as to get East to promise to give the new
plan a fair trial.</p>

<p>Encouraged by his success, in the evening, when they
were sitting alone in the large study, where East lived
now almost, "vice<a name="FNanchor_14_679" id="FNanchor_14_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_679" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Arthur on leave," after examining
the new fishing-rod, which both pronounced to be the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
genuine article ("play<a name="FNanchor_15_680" id="FNanchor_15_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_680" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> enough to throw a midge<a name="FNanchor_16_681" id="FNanchor_16_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_681" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> tied on
a single hair against the wind, and strength enough to
hold a grampus<a name="FNanchor_17_682" id="FNanchor_17_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_682" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>") they naturally began talking about
Arthur. Tom, who was still bubbling over with last night's
scene and all the thoughts of the last week, and wanting
to clinch and fix the whole in his own mind, which he
could never do without first going through the process of
belaboring somebody else with it all, suddenly rushed
into the subject of Arthur's illness, and what he had said
about death.</p>

<p>East had given him the desired opening; after a seriocomic
grumble, "that life wasn't worth having now they
were tied to a young beggar who was always 'raising his
standard';<a name="FNanchor_18_683" id="FNanchor_18_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_683" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and that he, East, was like a prophet's donkey,
who was obliged to struggle on after the donkey-man who
went after the prophet; that he had none of the pleasure
of starting the new crotchets, and didn't half understand
them, but had to take the kicks and carry the luggage as
if he had all the fun," he threw his legs up on to the sofa,
and put his hands behind his head, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, after all, he's the most wonderful little fellow I
ever came across. There isn't such a meek, humble boy
in the school. Hanged if I don't think now really, Tom,
that he believes himself a much worse fellow than you or
I, and that he doesn't think he has more influence in the
house than Dot Bowles, who came last quarter, and isn't
ten yet. But he turns you and me round his little finger,
old boy&mdash;there's no mistake about that." And East nodded
at Tom sagaciously.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
"Now or never!" thought Tom; so, shutting his eyes
and hardening his heart, he went straight at it, repeating
all that Arthur had said, as near as he could remember it,
in the very words, and all he had himself thought. The
life seemed to ooze out of it as he went on, and several
times he felt inclined to stop, give it all up, and change
the subject. But somehow he was borne on, he had a
necessity upon him to speak it all out, and did so. At the
end he looked at East with some anxiety, and was delighted
to see that that young gentleman was thoughtful
and attentive. The fact is, that in the stage of his inner
life at which Tom had lately arrived, his intimacy with
and friendship for East could not have lasted if he had
not made him aware of, and a sharer in, the thoughts that
were beginning to exercise him. Nor indeed could the
friendship have lasted if East had shown no sympathy
with these thoughts; so that it was a great relief to have
unbosomed himself, and to have found that his friend
could listen.</p>

<h4>FRIENDSHIP.</h4>

<p>Tom had always had a sort of instinct that East's levity
was only skin-deep; and this instinct was a true one.
East had no want of reverence for anything that he felt
to be real, but he was one of those natures that burst into
what is generally called recklessness and impiety the
moment they feel that anything is being poured upon
them for their good, which does not come home to their
inborn sense of right, or which appeals to anything like
self-interest in them. Daring and honest by nature, and
outspoken to an extent which alarmed all respectabilities,
with a constant fund of animal health and spirits which
he did not feel bound to curb in any way, he had gained
for himself with the steady part of the school (including
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
as well those who wished to appear steady as those who
really were so) the character of a boy with whom it would
be dangerous to be intimate; while his own hatred of everything
cruel, or underhand, or false, and his hearty respect
for what he could see to be good and true, kept off the
rest.</p>

<p>Tom, besides being very like East in many points of
character, had largely developed in his composition the
capacity for taking the weakest side. This is not putting
it strongly enough; it was a necessity with him; he
couldn't help it any more than he could eating or drinking.
He could never play on the strongest side with any
heart at foot-ball or cricket, and was sure to make friends
with any boy who was unpopular, or down on his luck.</p>

<p>Now, though East was not what is generally called unpopular,
Tom felt more and more every day, as their characters
developed, that he stood alone, and did not make
friends among their contemporaries; and therefore sought
him out. Tom was himself much more popular, for his
power of detecting humbug was much less acute, and his
instincts were much more sociable. He was at this period
of his life, too, largely given to taking people for what
they gave themselves out to be; but his singleness of
heart, fearlessness and honesty were just what East appreciated,
and thus the two had been drawn into great
intimacy.</p>

<p>This intimacy had been interrupted by Tom's guardianship
of Arthur.</p>

<h4>FRIENDSHIP TESTED.</h4>

<p>East had often, as has been said, joined them in reading
the Bible, but their discussion had almost always
turned upon the characters of the men and women of
whom they read, and not become personal to themselves.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
In fact, the two had shrunk from personal religious discussion,
not knowing how it might end; and fearful of
risking a friendship very dear to both, and which they
felt somehow, without quite knowing why, would never
be the same, but either tenfold stronger or sapped<a name="FNanchor_19_684" id="FNanchor_19_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_684" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> at its
foundation, after such communing together.</p>

<p>What a bother all this explaining is! I wish we could
get on without it. But we can't. However, you'll all
find, if you haven't found it out already, that a time
comes in every human friendship when you must go down
into the depths of yourself, and lay bare what is there to
your friend, and wait in fear for his answer. A few moments
may do it; and it may be (most likely will be, as
you are English boys) that you will never do it but once.
But done it must be, if the friendship is to be worth the
name. You must find what is there, at the very root and
bottom of one another's hearts; and if you are at one
there, nothing on earth can, or at least ought to, sunder
you.</p>

<h4>EAST'S CONFESSIONS.</h4>

<p>East had remained lying down until Tom finished
speaking, as if fearing to interrupt him; he now sat up
at the table and leant his head on one hand, taking up a
pencil with the other, and working little holes with it in
the table cover. After a bit he looked up, stopped the
pencil, and said: "Thank you very much, old fellow;
there's no other boy in the house would have done it for
me but you or Arthur. I can see well enough," he went
on, after a pause, "all the best big fellows look on me
with suspicion; they think I'm a devil-may-care, reckless
young scamp. So I am,&mdash;eleven hours out of twelve,&mdash;but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
not the twelfth. Then all our contemporaries worth
knowing follow suit, of course; we're very good friends at
games and all that, but not a soul of them but you
and Arthur ever tried to break through the crust, and
see whether there was anything at the bottom of me:
and then the bad ones I won't stand, and they know
that."</p>

<p>"Don't you think that's half fancy, Harry?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," said East, bitterly, pegging away
with his pencil. "I see it all plain enough. Bless you, you
think everybody's as straightforward and kind-hearted as
you are."</p>

<p>"Well, but what's the reason of it? There must be a
reason. You can play all the games as well as any one,
and sing the best songs, and are the best company in the
house. You fancy you're not liked, Harry. It's all fancy."</p>

<p>"I only wish it was, Tom. I know I could be popular
enough with all the bad ones, but that I won't have, and
the good ones won't have me."</p>

<p>"Why not?" persisted Tom; "you don't drink or
swear, or get out at night; you never bully, or cheat at
lessons. If you only showed you liked it, you'd have all
the best fellows in the house running after you."</p>

<p>"Not I," said East. Then, with an effort, he went on:
"I'll tell you what it is. I never stop during the Sacrament.
I can see, from the Doctor downward, how that
tells against me."</p>

<p>"Yes, I've seen that," said Tom, "and I've been very
sorry for it, and Arthur and I have talked about it. I've
often thought of speaking to you, but it's so hard to begin
on such subjects. I'm very glad you've opened it. Now,
why don't you!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
"I've never been confirmed,"<a name="FNanchor_20_685" id="FNanchor_20_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_685" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> said East.</p>

<p>"Not been confirmed!" said Tom, in astonishment.
"I never thought of that. Why weren't you confirmed
with the rest of us nearly three years ago? I always
thought you'd been confirmed at home."</p>

<p>"No," answered East, sorrowfully; "you see this was how
it happened. Last confirmation was soon after Arthur came,
and you were so taken up with him, I hardly saw either of
you. Well, when the Doctor sent round for us about it, I
was living mostly with Green's set&mdash;you know the sort.
They all went in&mdash;I dare say it was all right, and they got
good by it; I don't want to judge them. Only all I could
see of their reasons drove me just the other way. 'Twas 'because
the Doctor liked it'; no boy got on who didn't stay
the Sacrament; it was 'the correct thing,' in fact, like
having a good hat to wear on Sundays. I couldn't stand
it. I didn't feel that I wanted to lead a different life, I was
very well content as I was, and I wasn't going to sham
religious to curry favor<a name="FNanchor_21_686" id="FNanchor_21_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_686" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> with the Doctor, or any one else."</p>

<p>East stopped speaking, and pegged away more diligently
than ever with his pencil. Tom was ready to cry. He
felt half sorry at first that he had been confirmed himself.
He seemed to have deserted his earliest friend, to have
left him by himself at his worst need for those long years.
He got up and went and sat by East, and put his arm
over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Dear old boy," he said, "how careless and selfish I've
been! But why didn't you come and talk to Arthur and
me?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span></p>
<p>"I wish to Heaven I had," said East, "but I was a fool.
It's too late talking of it now."</p>

<p>"Why too late? You want to be confirmed now, don't
you?"</p>

<p>"I think so," said East. "I've thought about it a good
deal; only often I fancy I must be changing, because I see
it's to do me good here&mdash;just what stopped me last time.
And then I go back again."</p>

<h4>TOM'S PRESCRIPTION.</h4>

<p>"I'll tell you now how 'twas with me," said Tom, warmly.
"If it hadn't been for Arthur, I should have done just as
you did. I hope I should. I honor you for it. But then he
made it out just as if it was taking the weak side before
all the world&mdash;going in once for all against everything
that's strong and rich and proud and respectable, a little
band of brothers against the whole world. And the Doctor
seemed to say so, too, only he said a great deal more."</p>

<p>"Ah!" groaned East, "but there again, that's just another
of my difficulties whenever I think about the matter.
I don't want to be one of your saints, one of your
elect,<a name="FNanchor_22_687" id="FNanchor_22_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_687" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> whatever the right phrase is. My sympathies are
all the other way; with the many, the poor wretches who
run about the streets and don't go to church. Don't
stare, Tom; mind, I'm telling you all that's in my heart,&mdash;as
far as I know it,&mdash;but it's all a muddle. You must be
gentle with me if you want to land me.<a name="FNanchor_23_688" id="FNanchor_23_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_688" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Now I've seen a
deal of this sort of religion: I was bred up in it, and I
can't stand it. If nineteen-twentieths of the world are to
be left to uncovenanted mercies,<a name="FNanchor_24_689" id="FNanchor_24_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_689" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and that sort of thing,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
which means in plain English to go to destruction and the
other twentieth are to rejoice at it all, why&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh I but, Harry, they're not, they don't," broke in
Tom, really shocked. "Oh! how I wish Arthur hadn't
gone! I'm such a fool about these things. But it's all
you want, too, East; it is indeed. It cuts both ways
somehow&mdash;being confirmed and taking the Sacrament. It
makes you feel on the side of all the good and all the bad,
too, of everybody in the world. Only there's some great,
dark, strong power, which is crushing you and everybody
else. That's what Christ conquered, and we've got to
fight. What a fool I am. I can't explain. If Arthur
were only here!"</p>

<p>"I begin to get a glimmering of what you mean," said
East.</p>

<p>"I say, now," said Tom, eagerly, "do you remember
how we both hated Flashman?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do," said East; "I hate him still. What
then?"</p>

<p>"Well, when I came to take the Sacrament, I had a
great struggle about that. I tried to put him out of my
head; and when I couldn't do that, I tried to think of him
as evil, as something that the Lord who was loving me
hated, and which I might hate too. But it wouldn't do.
I broke down; I believe Christ himself broke me down;
and when the Doctor gave me the bread and wine, and
leaned over me praying, I prayed for poor Flashman, as if
it had been you or Arthur."</p>

<p>East buried his face in his hands on the table. Tom could
feel the table tremble. At last he looked up. "Thank
you again, Tom," said he; "you don't know what you may
have done for me to-night. I think I see now how the
right sort of sympathy with poor wretches is got at."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
"And you'll stop for the Sacrament next time, won't
you?" said Tom.</p>

<p>"Can I, before I'm confirmed?"</p>

<p>"Go and ask the Doctor."</p>

<p>"I will."</p>

<p>That very night, after prayers, East followed the Doctor
and the old verger bearing the candle, up stairs. Tom
watched and saw the Doctor turn round when he heard
foot-steps following him closer than usual, and say "Hah,
East! Do you want to speak to me, my man?"</p>

<p>"If you please, sir;" and the private door closed, and
Tom went to his study in a state of great trouble of mind.</p>

<h4>THE EFFECT THEREOF.</h4>

<p>It was almost an hour before East came back; then he
rushed in breathless.</p>

<p>"Well, it's all right," he shouted, seizing Tom by the
hand. "I feel as if a ton weight were off my mind."</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" said Tom. "I knew it would be, but tell
us all about it."</p>

<p>"Well I just told him all about it. You can't think
how kind and gentle he was,&mdash;the great grim man, whom
I've feared more than anybody on earth. When I stuck,
he lifted me, just as if I had been a little child. And he
seemed to know all I'd felt, and to have gone through it
all. And I burst out crying,&mdash;more than I have done
this five years,&mdash;and he sat down by me, and stroked my
head; and I went blundering on, and told him all; much
worse things than I've told you. And he wasn't shocked
a bit, and didn't snub me, or tell me I was a fool, and it
was all nothing but pride or wickedness, though I dare
say it was. And he didn't tell me not to follow out my
thoughts, and he didn't give me any cut-and-dried explanation.
But when I'd done he just talked a bit,&mdash;I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
can hardly remember what he said, yet; but it seemed to
spread round me like healing, and strength, and light;
and to bear me up, and plant me on a rock, where I could
hold my footing, and fight for myself. I don't know what
to do, I feel so happy. And it's all owing to you, dear
old boy!" and he seized Tom's hand again.</p>

<p>"And you're to come to the Communion?" said Tom.</p>

<p>"Yes, and to be confirmed in the holidays."</p>

<p>Tom's delight was as great as his friend's. But he
hadn't yet had out all his own talk, and was bent on
improving the occasion; so he proceeded to propound
Arthur's theory about not being sorry for his friends'
death, which he had hitherto kept in the background, and
by which he was much exercised;<a name="FNanchor_25_690" id="FNanchor_25_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_690" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> for he didn't feel it
honest to take what pleased him and throw over the rest,
and was trying vigorously to persuade himself that he
should like all his best friends to die off-hand.</p>

<p>But East's powers of remaining serious were exhausted,
and in five minutes he was saying the most ridiculous
things he could think of, till Tom was almost getting
angry again.</p>

<p>Despite of himself, however, he couldn't help laughing
and giving it up, when East appealed to him with:
"Well, Tom, you aren't going to punch my head, I hope,
because I insist on being sorry when you get to earth?"<a name="FNanchor_26_691" id="FNanchor_26_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_691" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>And so their talk finished for that time, and they tried
to learn first lesson, with very poor success, as appeared
next morning, when they were called up and narrowly
escaped being floored, which ill-luck, however, did not sit
heavily on either of their souls.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>TOM BROWN'S LAST MATCH.</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class="poem"><p>
"Heaven grant the manlier heart, that timely, ere<br />
Youth fly, with life's real tempest would be coping;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">The fruit of dreamy hoping</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Is, waking, blank despair."</span><br />
</p></div>
<p style='text-align:right'><i>Clough</i>, "<i>Ambarvalia.</i>"</p>
</div>

<p>The curtain now rises upon the last act of our little
drama,&mdash;for hard-hearted publishers warn me that a
single volume must of necessity have an end. Well, well!
the pleasantest things must come to an end. I little
thought last long vacation, when I began these pages to
help while away some spare time at a watering-place, how
vividly many an old scene, which had lain hid away for
years in some dusty old corner of my brain, would come
back again, and stand before me clear and bright as if it
had happened yesterday. The book has been a most
grateful task to me, and I only hope that all you, my dear
young friends, who read it (friends assuredly you must be
if you get as far as this), will be half as sorry to come to
the last stage as I am.</p>

<p>Not but what there has been a solemn and sad side to
it. As the old scenes became living, and the actors in
them became living, too, many a grave in the Crimea and
distant India, as well as in the quiet church-yards of our
dear old country, seemed to open and send forth their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
dead, and their voices, and looks, and ways were again in
one's ears and eyes, as in the old school-days. But this
was not sad; how should it be, if we believe as our Lord
has taught us? How should it be, when one more turn
of the wheel, and we shall be by their sides again, learning
from them again, perhaps, as we did when we were
new boys?</p>

<p>Then there were others of the old faces so dear to us
once, who had somehow or another just gone clean out of
sight&mdash;are they dead or living? We know not, but the
thought of them brings no sadness with it. Wherever
they are, we can well believe they are doing God's work,
and getting His wages.</p>

<h4>SCHOOL MEMORIES.</h4>

<p>But are there not some, whom we still see sometimes in
the streets, whose haunts and homes we know, whom we
could probably find almost any day in the week if we were
set to do it, yet from whom we are really further than we
are from the dead, and from those who have gone out of
our ken?<a name="FNanchor_1_692" id="FNanchor_1_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_692" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Yes, there are and must be such; and therein
lies the sadness of old school memories. Yet of these our
old comrades, from whom more than time and space separate
us, there are some by whose sides we can feel sure
that we shall stand again when time shall be no more.
We may think of one another now as dangerous fanatics
or narrow bigots, with whom no truce is possible, from
whom we shall only sever more and more to the end of our
lives, whom it would be our respective duties to imprison
or hang, if we had the power. We must go our way, and
they theirs, as long as flesh and spirit hold together; but
let our own Rugby poet speak words of healing for this
trial:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><p>
"To veer how vain! on, onward strain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Brave barks! in light, in darkness, too;</span><br />
Through winds and tides one compass guides,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To that, and your own selves, be true.</span><br />
<br />
"But, O blithe breeze! and O great seas!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though ne'er, that earliest parting past,</span><br />
On your wide plain they join again,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Together lead them home at last.</span><br />
<br />
"One port, methought, alike they sought,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One purpose hold where'er they fare,</span><br />
O bounding breeze! O rushing seas!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At last, at last, unite them there!"&mdash;<i>Clough.</i><a name="FNanchor_2_693" id="FNanchor_2_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_693" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></span><br />
</p></div>

<p>This is not mere longing, it is prophecy. So over these
two, our old friends who are friends no more, we sorrow
not as men without hope. It is only for those who seem
to us to have lost compass and purpose, and to be driven
helplessly on rocks and quicksands; whose lives are spent
in the service of the world, the flesh, and the devil; for
self alone, and not for their fellow-men, their country, or
their God, that we must mourn and pray without sure
hope and without light; trusting only that He, in whose
hands they are as well as we are, who has died for them as
well as for us, who sees all His creatures&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><p>
"With larger, other eyes than ours,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To make allowance for us all,"<a name="FNanchor_3_694" id="FNanchor_3_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_694" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>&mdash;</span><br />
</p></div>

<p>will, in His own way and at his own time, lead them also
home.</p>

<h4>THE END OF THE HALF-YEAR.</h4>

<p>Another two years have passed, and it is again the end
of the Summer half-year at Rugby; in fact, the school has
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
broken up. The fifth-form examinations were over last
week, and upon them have followed the speeches, and
the sixth-form examinations for exhibitions;<a name="FNanchor_4_695" id="FNanchor_4_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_695" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and they,
too, are over now. The boys have gone to all the winds of
heaven, except the town boys and the eleven, and the few
enthusiasts besides who have asked leave to stay in their
houses to see the result of the cricket-matches. For this
year the Wellesburn return match and the Marylebone
match are played at Rugby, to the great delight of the
town and neighborhood, and the sorrow of those aspiring
young cricketers who have been reckoning for the last
three months on showing off at Lord's grounds.<a name="FNanchor_5_696" id="FNanchor_5_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_696" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>The Doctor started off for the Lakes<a name="FNanchor_6_697" id="FNanchor_6_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_697" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> yesterday morning,
after an interview with the captain of the eleven, in the
presence of Thomas, at which he arranged in what school
the cricket dinners were to be, and all other matters necessary
for the satisfactory carrying out of the festivities;
and warned them as to keeping all spirituous liquors out
of the close, and having the gates closed by nine o'clock.</p>

<h4>CRICKET-MATCHES.</h4>

<p>The Wellesburn match was played out with great success
yesterday, the School winning by three wickets;<a name="FNanchor_7_698" id="FNanchor_7_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_698" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and
to-day the great event of the cricketing year, the Marylebone
match, is being played. What a match it has been!
The London eleven came down by an afternoon train yesterday,
in time to see the end of the Wellesburn match;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
and as soon as it was over, their leading men and umpire
inspected the ground, criticising it rather unmercifully.
The captain of the School eleven, and one or two others,
who had played the Lord's match before, and knew old
Mr. Aislabie and several of the Lord's men, accompanied
them; while the rest of the eleven looked on from under
the Three Trees with admiring eyes, and asked one another
the names of the illustrious strangers, and recounted how
many runs each of them had made in the late matches in
<i>Bell's Life</i>. They looked such hard-bitten,<a name="FNanchor_8_699" id="FNanchor_8_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_699" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> wiry, whiskered
fellows, that their young adversaries felt rather desponding
as to the result of the morrow's match. The ground was
at last chosen, and two men set to work to water and roll
it; and then, there being yet some half-hour of daylight,
some one had suggested a dance on the turf. The close
was half full of citizens and their families, and the idea
was hailed with enthusiasm. The cornopean-player was
still on the ground; in five minutes the eleven, and half a
dozen of the Wellesburn and Marylebone men got partners
somehow or another, and a merry country dance
was going on, to which every one flocked, and new couples
joined in every minute, till there were a hundred of them
going down the middle and up again&mdash;and the long line
of school-buildings looked gravely down on them, every
window glowing with the last rays of the western sun,
and the rooks clanged about in the tops of the old elms,
greatly excited, and resolved on having their country
dance, too, and the great flag flapped lazily in the gentle
western breeze. Altogether it was a sight which would
have made glad the heart of our brave old founder, Lawrence
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
Sheriff,<a name="FNanchor_9_700" id="FNanchor_9_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_700" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> if he were half as good a fellow as I take
him to have been. It was a cheerful sight to see, but
what made it so valuable in the sight of the captain of
the School eleven was, that he saw there his young hands
shaking off their shyness and awe of the Lord's men, as
they crossed hands and capered about on the grass together;
for the strangers entered into it all, and threw
away their cigars, and danced and shouted like boys, while
old Mr. Aislabie stood by looking on in his white hat,
leaning on a bat, in benevolent enjoyment. "This hop
will be worth thirty runs<a name="FNanchor_10_701" id="FNanchor_10_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_701" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> to us to-morrow, and will be
the making of Raggles and Johnson," thinks the young
leader, as he revolves many things in his mind, standing
by the side of Mr. Aislabie, whom he will not leave for a
minute, for he feels that the character of the School for
courtesy is resting on his shoulders.</p>

<p>But when a quarter to nine struck, and he saw old
Thomas beginning to fidget about with the keys in his
hand, he thought of the Doctor's parting monition, and
stopped the cornopean at once, notwithstanding the loud-voiced
remonstrances from all sides; and the crowd scattered
away from the close, the eleven all going into the
School-house, where supper and beds were provided by
the Doctor's orders.</p>

<p>Deep had been the consultations at supper as to the
order of going in, who should bowl the first over,<a name="FNanchor_11_702" id="FNanchor_11_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_702" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> whether
it would be best to play steady or freely; and the youngest
hands declared that they shouldn't be a bit nervous,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
and praised their opponents as the jolliest fellows in the
world, except, perhaps, their old friends, the Wellesburn
men. How far a little good-nature from their elders will
go with the right sort of boys!</p>

<p>The morning had dawned bright and warm, to the intense
relief of many an anxious youngster, up betimes to
mark the signs of the weather. The eleven went down
in a body before breakfast for a plunge in the cold bath in
the corner of the close. The ground was in splendid
order, and soon after ten o'clock, before spectators had
arrived, all was ready, and two of the Lord's men took
their places at the wicket; the School, with the usual
liberality of young hands, having put their adversaries in
first. Old Bailey stepped up to the wicket, and called
play, and the match has begun.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<h4>THE MARYLEBONE MATCH.</h4>

<p>"Oh, well bowled! well bowled, Johnson!" cries the
captain, catching up the ball and sending it high above
the rook-trees, while the third Marylebone man walks
away from the wicket, and old Bailey gravely sets up the
middle stump<a name="FNanchor_12_703" id="FNanchor_12_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_703" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> again and puts the bails<a name="FNanchor_13_704" id="FNanchor_13_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_704" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> on.</p>

<p>"How many runs?" Away scamper three boys to the
scoring-table,<a name="FNanchor_14_705" id="FNanchor_14_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_705" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and are back again in a minute amongst
the rest of the eleven, who are collected together in a
knot between wickets.</p>

<p>"Only eighteen runs, and three wickets down!"</p>

<p>"Huzzah for old Rugby!" sings out Jack Raggles, the
long-stop,<a name="FNanchor_15_706" id="FNanchor_15_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_706" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> toughest and burliest of boys, commonly called
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
"Swiper Jack";<a name="FNanchor_16_707" id="FNanchor_16_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_707" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and forthwith stands on his head and brandishes
his legs in the air in triumph, till the next boy
catches hold of his heels and throws him over on his back.</p>

<p>"Steady there; don't be such an ass, Jack," says the
captain; "we haven't got the best wicket. Ah, look out
now at cover-point,"<a name="FNanchor_17_708" id="FNanchor_17_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_708" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> adds he, as he sees a long-armed,
bare-headed, slashing-looking player coming to the wicket.
"And, Jack, mind your hits; he steals more runs than
any man in England."</p>

<p>And they all find that they have got their work to do
now; the new-comer's off-hitting is tremendous, and his
running like a flash of lightning. He is never in his
ground, except when his wicket is down. Nothing in the
whole game so trying to boys; he has stolen three byes<a name="FNanchor_18_709" id="FNanchor_18_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_709" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
in the first ten minutes, and Jack Raggles is furious, and
begins throwing over savagely to the further wicket, until
he is sternly stopped by the captain. It is all that young
gentleman can do to keep his team<a name="FNanchor_19_710" id="FNanchor_19_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_710" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> steady, but he knows
that everything depends on it, and faces his work bravely.
The score creeps up to fifty, the boys begin to look blank,
and the spectators, who are now mustering strong, are
very silent. The ball flies off his bat to all parts of the
field, and he gives no rest and no catches to any one. But
cricket is full of glorious chances, and the goddess who
presides over it loves to bring down the most skilful
players. Johnson, the young bowler, is getting wild; and
bowls a ball almost wide to the off;<a name="FNanchor_20_711" id="FNanchor_20_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_711" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> the batter steps out
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
and cuts it beautifully to where cover-point is standing
very deep; in fact, almost off the ground. The ball comes
skimming and twisting along about three feet from the
ground; he rushes at it, and it sticks somehow or other
in the fingers of his left hand, to the utter astonishment
of himself and the whole field.</p>

<p>Such a catch hasn't been made in the close for years,
and the cheering is maddening. "Pretty cricket," says
the captain, throwing himself on the ground by the deserted
wicket, with a long breath; he feels that a crisis has
past.</p>

<p>I wish I had space to describe the match; how the captain
stumped the next man off a leg-shooter,<a name="FNanchor_21_712" id="FNanchor_21_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_712" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and bowled
small cobs<a name="FNanchor_22_713" id="FNanchor_22_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_713" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> to old Mr. Aislabie, who came in for the last
wicket. How the Lord's men were out by half-past twelve
o'clock for ninety-eight runs. How the captain of the
School eleven went in first to give his men pluck, and
scored twenty-five in beautiful style; how Rugby was only
four behind in the first innings<a name="FNanchor_23_714" id="FNanchor_23_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_714" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> What a glorious dinner
they had in the fourth-form School, and how the cover-point
hitter sang the most topping<a name="FNanchor_24_715" id="FNanchor_24_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_715" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> comic songs, and old
Mr. Aislabie made the best speeches that ever were heard,
afterward. But I haven't space, that's the fact, and so
you must fancy it all and carry yourselves on to half-past
seven o'clock, when the School are again in, with five
wickets down, and only thirty-two runs to make to win.
The Marylebone men played carelessly in their second innings,
but they are working like horses now to save the
match.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span></p>
<h4>SOME OLD FRIENDS.</h4>

<p>There is much healthy, hearty, happy life scattered up
and down the close; but the group to which I beg to call
your special attention is there on the slope of the island,
which looks toward the cricket-ground. It consists of three
figures: two are seated on the bench, and one on the ground
at their feet. The first, a tall, slight, and rather gaunt
man, with a bushy eyebrow, and a dry, humorous smile,
is evidently a clergyman. He is carelessly dressed, and
looks rather used up, which isn't much to be wondered at,
seeing that he has just finished six weeks of examination
work: but there he basks, and spreads himself out in the
evening sun, bent on enjoying life, though he doesn't quite
know what to do with his arms and legs. Surely it is our
friend the young master, whom we have had glimpses of
before, but his face has gained a great deal since we last
came across him.</p>

<p>And by his side, in white flannel shirt and trousers,
straw hat, the captain's belt, and the untanned yellow
cricket-shoes which all the eleven wear, sits a strapping
figure, near six feet high, with ruddy tanned face and
whiskers, curly brown hair, and a laughing, dancing eye.
He is leaning forward, with his elbows resting on his
knees, and dandling his favorite bat, with which he has
made thirty or forty runs to-day, in his strong brown
hands. It is Tom Brown, grown into a young man nineteen
years old, a pr&aelig;postor and captain of the eleven,
spending his last day as a Rugby boy, and let us hope as
much wiser as he is bigger since we last had the pleasure
of coming across him.</p>

<p>And at their feet on the warm dry ground, similarly
dressed, sits Arthur, Turkish fashion, with his bat across
his knees. He, too, is no longer a boy, less of a boy in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
fact than Tom, if one may judge from the thoughtfulness
of his face, which is somewhat paler, too, than one could
wish; but his figure, though slight, is well knit and active,
and all his old timidity has disappeared, and is replaced
by silent quaint fun, with which his face twinkles all over,
as he listens to the broken talk between the other two, in
which he joins now and then.</p>

<p>All three are watching the game eagerly, and joining in
the cheering that follows every good hit. It is pleasing
to see the easy friendly footing which the pupils are on
with their master, perfectly respectful, yet with no reserve
and nothing forced in their intercourse. Tom has clearly
abandoned the old theory of "natural enemies" in this
case at any rate.</p>

<h4>THEIR TALK.</h4>

<p>But it is time to listen to what they are saying, and see
what we can gather out of it.</p>

<p>"I don't object to your theory," says the master, "and
I allow you have made a fair case for yourself. But, now,
in such books as Aristophanes, for instance, you've been
reading a play this half with the Doctor, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, 'The Knights,'"<a name="FNanchor_25_716" id="FNanchor_25_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_716" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> answered Tom.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm sure you would have enjoyed the wonderful
humor of it twice as much if you had taken more pains
with your scholarship."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I don't believe any boy in the form enjoyed
the set-tos<a name="FNanchor_26_717" id="FNanchor_26_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_717" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> between Cleon and the sausage-seller more
than I did&mdash;eh, Arthur?" said Tom, giving him a stir
with his foot.</p>

<p>"Yes, I must say he did," said Arthur. "I think, sir,
you've hit upon the wrong book there."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
"Not a bit of it," said the master. "Why, in those
very passages of arms, how can you thoroughly appreciate
them unless you are masters of the weapons? and the
weapons are the language, which you, Brown, have never
half worked at; and so, as I say, you must have lost all
the delicate shades of meaning which make the best part
of the fun."</p>

<p>"Oh! well played&mdash;bravo, Johnson!" shouted Arthur,
dropping his hat and clapping furiously, and Tom joined
in with a "Bravo, Johnson!" which might have been
heard at the chapel.</p>

<p>"Eh! what is it? I didn't see," inquired the master;
"they only got one run, I thought?"</p>

<p>"No, but such a ball, three-quarters length, and coming
straight for his leg-bail.<a name="FNanchor_27_718" id="FNanchor_27_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_718" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Nothing but that turn of
the wrist could have saved him, and he drew it away to
leg<a name="FNanchor_28_719" id="FNanchor_28_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_719" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> for a safe one. Bravo, Johnson!"</p>

<p>"How well they are bowling, though," said Arthur;
"they don't mean to be beat, I can see."</p>

<p>"There, now," struck in the master "you see that's just
what I have been preaching this half-hour. The delicate
play is the true thing. I don't understand cricket, so I
don't enjoy those fine draws<a name="FNanchor_29_720" id="FNanchor_29_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_720" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> which you tell me are the
best play, though when you or Raggles hit a ball hard
away for six,<a name="FNanchor_30_721" id="FNanchor_30_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_721" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> I am as delighted as any one. Don't you
see the analogy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," answered Tom, looking up roguishly, "I see;
only the question remains whether I should have got
most good by understanding Greek particles or cricket
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
thoroughly. I'm such a thick, I never should have had
time for both."</p>

<p>"I see you are an incorrigible," said the master, with a
chuckle; "but I refute you by an example. Arthur there
has taken in Greek and cricket, too."</p>

<p>"Yes, but no thanks to him; Greek came natural to
him. Why, when he first came I remember he used to
read Herodotus<a name="FNanchor_31_722" id="FNanchor_31_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_722" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> for pleasure, as I did Don Quixote,<a name="FNanchor_32_723" id="FNanchor_32_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_723" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> and
couldn't have made a false concord if he tried ever so
hard&mdash;and then I looked after his cricket."</p>

<p>"Out! Bailey has given him out&mdash;do you see, Tom?"
cries Arthur. " How foolish of them to run so hard!"</p>

<p>"Well, it can't be helped, he has played very well.
Whose turn is it to go in?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; they've got your list in the tent."</p>

<p>"Let's go and see," said Tom, rising; but at this moment
Jack Raggles and two or three more came running
to the island moat.</p>

<p>"Oh, Brown, mayn't I go in next?" shouts the Swiper.</p>

<p>"Whose name is next on the list?" says the captain.</p>

<p>"Winter's, and then Arthur's," answers the boy who
carries it; "but there are only twenty-six runs to get, and
no time to lose. I heard Mr. Aislabie say that the stumps
must be drawn at a quarter past eight exactly."</p>

<p>"Oh, do let the Swiper go in," chorus the boys; so Tom
yields against his better judgment.</p>

<p>"I dare say now I've lost the match by this nonsense,"
he says, as he sits down again; "they'll be sure to get
Jack's wicket in three or four minutes; however, you'll
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
have the chance, sir, of seeing a hard hit or two," adds he,
smiling, and turning to the master.</p>

<p>"Come, none of your irony, Brown," answers the master.
"I'm beginning to understand the game scientifically.
What a noble game it is, too!"</p>

<p>"Isn't it? But it's more than a game. It's an institution."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Arthur, "the birth-right of British boys old
and young, as <i>habeas corpus</i><a name="FNanchor_33_724" id="FNanchor_33_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_724" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> and trial by jury are of
British men."</p>

<p>"The discipline and reliance on one another which it
teaches, is so valuable, I think," went on the master; "it
ought to be such an unselfish game. It merges the individual
in the eleven; he doesn't play that he may win,
but that his side may."</p>

<p>"That's very true," said Tom, "and that's why foot-ball
and cricket, now one comes to think of it, are much better
games than fives or hare-and-hounds, or any others where
the object is to come in first or to win for one's self, and
not that one's side may win."</p>

<p>"And then the captain of the eleven!" said the master,
"what a post is his in our school-world! almost as hard
as the Doctor's; requiring skill and gentleness and firmness,
and I know not what other rare qualities."</p>

<p>"Which doesn't he wish he may get!" said Tom,
laughing; "at any rate he hasn't got them yet, or he
wouldn't have been such a flat<a name="FNanchor_34_725" id="FNanchor_34_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_725" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> as to let Jack Raggles go
in, out of his turn."</p>

<p>"Ah, the Doctor never would have done that," said
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
Arthur, demurely. "Tom, you've a great deal to learn yet
in the art of ruling."</p>

<p>"Well, I wish you'd tell the Doctor so, then, and get
him to let me stop till I'm twenty. I don't want to leave,
I'm sure."</p>

<p>"What a sight it is," broke in the master, "the Doctor
as a ruler! Perhaps ours is the only little corner in the
British Empire which is thoroughly, wisely, and strongly
ruled just now. I'm more and more thankful every day
of my life that I came here to be under him."</p>

<p>"So am I, I'm sure," said Tom; " and more and more
sorry that I've got to leave."</p>

<p>"Every place and thing one sees here reminds one of
some wise act of his," went on the master. "This island
now&mdash;you remember the time, Brown, when it was first
laid out in small gardens, and cultivated by frost-bitten
fags in February and March?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do," said Tom; "didn't I hate spending
two hours in the afternoon grubbing in the tough dirt
with the stump of a fives'-bat? But turf-cart<a name="FNanchor_35_726" id="FNanchor_35_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_726" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> was good
fun enough."</p>

<p>"I dare say it was, but it was always leading to fights
with the townspeople; and then the stealing flowers out of
all the gardens in Rugby for the Easter show was abominable."</p>

<p>"Well, so it was," said Tom, looking down, "but we
fags couldn't help ourselves. But what has that to do
with the Doctor's ruling?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
"A great deal, I think," said the master; "what
brought island-fagging to an end?"</p>

<p>"Why, the Easter speeches were put off till midsummer,"
said Tom, "and the sixth had gymnastic poles put
up here."</p>

<p>"Well, and who changed the time of the speeches, and
put the idea of gymnastic poles into the heads of their
worships,<a name="FNanchor_36_727" id="FNanchor_36_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_727" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> the sixth form?" said the master.</p>

<p>"The Doctor, I suppose," said Tom. " I never thought
of that."</p>

<p>"Of course you didn't," said the master, "or else, fag
as you were, you would have shouted with the whole
school against putting down old customs. And that's the
way that all the Doctor's reforms have been carried out
when he has been left to himself,&mdash;quietly and naturally,
putting a good thing in the place of a bad, and letting
the bad die out; no wavering and no hurry,&mdash;the best
thing that could be done for the time-being, and patience
for the rest."</p>

<p>"Just Tom's own way," chimed in Arthur, nudging
Tom with his elbow, "driving a nail where it will go";
to which allusions Tom answered by a sly kick.</p>

<p>"Exactly so," said the master, innocent of the allusion
and by-play.</p>

<h4>JACK RAGGLES'S INNINGS.</h4>

<p>Meantime Jack Raggles, with his sleeves tucked up
above his great brown elbows, scorning pads and gloves,
has presented himself at the wicket; and, having run one
for a forward drive off Johnson's, is about to receive his
first ball. There are only twenty-four runs to make, and
four wickets to go down, a winning match if they play
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
decently steady. The ball is a very swift one, and rises
fast, catching Jack on the outside of the thigh, and bounding
away, as if from india-rubber, while they run two for
a leg-bye<a name="FNanchor_37_728" id="FNanchor_37_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_728" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> amidst great applause and shouts from Jack's
many admirers. The next ball is a beautifully pitched
ball for the outer stump, which the reckless and unfeeling
Jack catches hold of, and hits right round to leg for five,
while the applause is deafening; only seventeen runs to
get with four wickets,&mdash;the game is all but ours!</p>

<p>It is over now, and Jack walks swaggering about his
wicket, with his bat over his shoulder, while Mr. Aislabie
holds a short parley with his men. Then the cover-point
hitter, that cunning man, goes on to bowl slow twisters.
Jack waves his hand triumphantly toward the tent, as
much as to say: "See if I don't finish it all off now in
three hits!"</p>

<p>Alas, my son Jack! the enemy is too old for thee. The
first ball of the over, Jack steps out and meets, swiping<a name="FNanchor_38_729" id="FNanchor_38_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_729" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
with all his force. If he had only allowed for the twist!
but he hasn't, and so the ball goes spinning up straight
in the air as if it would never come down again. Away
runs Jack, shouting and trusting to the chapter of accidents,
but the bowler runs steadily under it, judging
every spin, and calling out: "I have it," catches it, and
playfully pitches it on to the back of the stalwart Jack,
who is departing with a rueful countenance.</p>

<p>"I knew how it would be," says Tom, rising. "Come
along; the game's getting very serious."</p>

<p>So they leave the island and go to the tent, and after
deep consultation Arthur is sent in, and goes off to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
wicket with a last exhortation from Tom to play steady
and keep his bat straight. To the suggestions that Winter
is the best bat left Tom only replies: "Arthur is the
steadiest, and Johnson will make the runs if the wicket is
only kept up."</p>

<p>"I am surprised to see Arthur in the eleven," said the
master, as they stood together in front of the dense
crowd, which was now closing in round the ground.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not quite sure that he ought to be in for
his play,"<a name="FNanchor_39_730" id="FNanchor_39_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_730" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> said Tom, "but I couldn't help putting him
in. It will do him so much good, and you can't think
what I owe him."</p>

<h4>THE FINISH.</h4>

<p>The master smiled. The clock strikes eight, and the
whole field becomes fevered with excitement. Arthur,
after two narrow escapes, scores one; and Johnson gets the
ball. The bowling and fielding are superb, and Johnson's
batting worthy the occasion. He makes here a two and
there a one, managing to keep the ball to himself, and
Arthur backs up and runs perfectly; only eleven runs to
make now, and the crowd scarcely breathe. At last Arthur
gets the ball again, and actually drives it forward
for two, and feels prouder than when he got the three
best prizes, at hearing Tom's shout of joy, "Well played,
well played, young un!"</p>

<p>But the next ball is too much for a young hand, and
his bails fly different ways. Nine runs to make, and two
wickets to go down&mdash;it is too much for human nerves.</p>

<p>Before Winter can get in,<a name="FNanchor_40_731" id="FNanchor_40_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_731" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> the omnibus which is to take
the Lord's men to the train pulls up at the side of the
close, and Mr. Aislabie and Tom consult, and give out
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
that the stumps will be drawn after the next over. And
so ends the great match. Winter and Johnson carry out
their bats, and, it being a one day's match, the Lord's
men are declared the winners, they having scored the
most in the first innings.</p>

<p>But such a defeat is a victory; so think Tom and all the
School eleven, as they accompany their conquerors to
the omnibus, and send them off with three ringing cheers,
after Mr. Aislabie had shaken hands all round, saying to
Tom, "I must compliment you, sir, on your eleven, and
I hope we shall have you for a member if you come up to
town."<a name="FNanchor_41_732" id="FNanchor_41_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_732" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>As Tom and the rest of the eleven were turning back
into the close, and everybody was beginning to cry out
for another country dance, encouraged by the success of
the night before, the young master, who was just leaving
the close, stopped him, and asked him to come up to tea
at half-past eight, adding, "I won't keep you more than
half an hour, and ask Arthur to come up, too."</p>

<p>"I'll come up with you directly, if you'll let me," said
Tom, "for I feel rather melancholy, and not quite up to
the country dance and supper with the rest."</p>

<p>"Do, by all means," said the master; "I'll wait for
you."</p>

<p>So Tom went off to get his boots and things from the
tent, to tell Arthur of the invitation, and to speak to his
second in command about stopping the dancing and
shutting up the close as soon as it grew dusk. Arthur
promised to follow as soon as he had had a dance. So
Tom handed his things over to the man in charge of the
tent, and walked quietly away to the gate where the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
master was waiting, and the two took their way together
up the Hillmorton road.</p>

<h4>SHUT OUT.</h4>

<p>Of course they found the master's house locked up, and
all the servants away in the close, about this time, no
doubt, footing it away on the grass with extreme delight
to themselves, and in utter oblivion of the unfortunate
bachelor, their master, whose one enjoyment in the shape
of meals was his "dish of tea" (as our grandmothers called
it) in the evening; and the phrase was apt in his case,
for he always poured his out into the saucer before drinking.
Great was the good man's horror at finding himself
shut out of his own house. Had he been alone he would
have treated it as a matter of course, and would have
strolled contentedly up and down his gravel-walk until
some one came home; but he was hurt at the stain on his
character of host, especially as the guest was a pupil.
However, the guest seemed to think it a great joke, and
presently, as they poked about round the house, mounted
a wall, from which he could reach a passage window;
the window, as it turned out, was not bolted, so in another
minute Tom was in the house and down at the front door,
which he opened from inside. The master chuckled
grimly at this burglarious entry, and insisted on leaving
the hall-door and two of the front windows open, to
frighten the truants on their return; and then the two
set about foraging for tea, in which operation the master
was much at fault, having the faintest possible idea of
where to find anything, and being moreover wondrously
short-sighted; but Tom, by a sort of instinct, knew the
right cupboards in the kitchen and pantry, and soon managed
to place on the snuggery<a name="FNanchor_42_733" id="FNanchor_42_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_733" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> table better materials for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
a meal than had appeared there probably during the reign
of his tutor, who was then and there initiated, amongst
other things, into the excellence of that mysterious condiment,
a dripping cake. The cake was newly baked, and
all rich and flaky; Tom had found it reposing in the
cook's private cupboard, awaiting her return; and, as a
warning to her, they finished it to the last crumb. The
kettle sang away merrily on the hob<a name="FNanchor_43_734" id="FNanchor_43_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_734" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> of the snuggery,
for, notwithstanding the time of year, they lighted a fire,
throwing both the windows wide open at the same time;
the heaps of books and papers were pushed away to the
other end of the table, and the great solitary engravings
of King's College Chapel<a name="FNanchor_44_735" id="FNanchor_44_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_735" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> over the mantle-piece looked
less stiff than usual, as they settled themselves down in
the twilight to the serious drinking of tea.</p>

<h4>HARRY EAST.</h4>

<p>After some talk on the match, and other indifferent
subjects, the conversation came naturally back to Tom's
approaching departure, over which he began again to
moan.</p>

<p>"Well, we shall miss you quite as much as you will
miss us," said the master. "You are the Nestor<a name="FNanchor_45_736" id="FNanchor_45_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_736" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> of the
School now, are you not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ever since East left," answered Tom.</p>

<p>"By the bye, have you heard from him?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I had a letter in February, just before he started
for India to join his regiment."</p>

<p>"He will make a capital officer."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
"Ay, won't he?" said Tom, brightening; "no fellow
could handle boys better, and I suppose soldiers are very
like boys. And he'll never tell them to go where he won't
go himself. No mistake about that,&mdash;a braver fellow
never walked."</p>

<p>"His year in the sixth will have taught him a good
deal that will be useful to him now."</p>

<p>"So it will," said Tom, staring into the fire. "Poor
dear Harry," he went on, "how well I remember the day
we were put out of the twenty.<a name="FNanchor_46_737" id="FNanchor_46_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_737" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> How he rose to the situation,
and burnt his cigar-cases, and gave away his pistols,
and pondered on the constitutional authority<a name="FNanchor_47_738" id="FNanchor_47_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_738" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> of the sixth
and his new duties to the Doctor, and the fifth form, and
the fags. Ay, and no fellow ever acted up to them better,
though he was always a people's man,&mdash;for the fags, and
against constituted authorities.<a name="FNanchor_48_739" id="FNanchor_48_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_739" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> He couldn't help that,
you know. I'm sure the Doctor must have liked him?"
said Tom, looking up inquiringly.</p>

<p>"The Doctor sees the good in every one, and appreciates
it," said the master, dogmatically;<a name="FNanchor_49_740" id="FNanchor_49_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_740" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> "but I hope East
will get a good colonel. He won't do if he can't respect
those above him. How long it took him, even here, to
learn the lesson of obeying."</p>

<p>"Well, I wish I were alongside of him," said Tom. "If
I can't be at Rugby, I want to be at work in the world,
and not dawdling away three years at Oxford."</p>

<h4>WORK IN THE WORLD.</h4>

<p>"What do you mean by 'at work in the world'?" said
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
the master, pausing, with his lips close to the saucerful of
tea, and peering at Tom over it.</p>

<p>"Well, I mean real work; one's profession; whatever
one will have really to do, and make one's living by. I
want to be doing some real good, feeling that I am not
only at play in the world," answered Tom, rather puzzled
to find out himself what he really did mean.</p>

<p>"You are mixing up two very different things in your
head, I think, Brown," said the master, putting down the
empty saucer, "and you ought to get clear about them.
You talk of 'working to get your living,' and 'doing
some real good in the world,' in the same breath. Now,
you may be getting a very good living in a profession, and
yet doing no good at all in the world, but quite the contrary
at the same time. Keep the latter before you as
your one object, and you will be right, whether you make
a living or not; but if you dwell on the other, you'll very
likely drop into mere money-making, and let the world
take care of itself for good or evil. Don't be in a hurry
about finding your work in the world for yourself; you
are not old enough to judge for yourself yet, but just look
about you in the place you find yourself in, and try to
make things a little better and honester there. You'll
find plenty to keep your hand in at Oxford, or wherever
else you go. And don't be led away to think this part of
the world important, and that unimportant. Every corner
of the world is important. No man knows whether
this part or that is most so, but every man may do some
honest work in his own corner." And then the good
man went on to talk wisely to Tom of the sort of work
which he might take up as an undergraduate, and warned
him of the prevalent University sins, and explained to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
him the many and great differences between University
and School life; till the twilight changed into darkness,
and they heard the truant servants stealing in by the back
entrance.</p>

<h4>THE DOCTOR'S WORK.</h4>

<p>"I wonder where Arthur can be," said Tom, at last,
looking at his watch; "why, it's nearly half-past nine
already."</p>

<p>"Oh, he is comfortably at supper with the eleven,
forgetful of his oldest friends," said his master. "Nothing
has given me greater pleasure," he went on, "than
your friendship for him; it has been the making of you
both."</p>

<p>"Of me, at any rate," answered Tom; "I should never
have been here now but for him. 'Twas the luckiest
chance in the world that sent him to Rugby, and made
him my chum."</p>

<p>"Why do you talk of lucky chances?" said the master.
"I don't know that there are any such things in the
world; at any rate there was neither luck nor chance in
that matter."</p>

<p>Tom looked at him inquiringly, and he went on: "Do
you remember when the Doctor lectured you and East at
the end of one half-year, when you were in the shell, and
had been getting into all sorts of scrapes?"</p>

<p>"Yes, well enough," said Tom: "it was the half-year
before Arthur came."</p>

<p>"Exactly so," answered the master. "Now I was with
him a few minutes afterward, and he was in great distress
about you two. And, after some talk, we both agreed
that you in particular wanted some object in the School
beyond games and mischief; for it was quite clear that
you never would make the regular school-work your first
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
object. And so the Doctor, at the beginning of the next
half-year, looked out the best of the new boys, and separated
you and East, and put the young boy into your
study, in the hope that when you had somebody to lean
on you, you would begin to stand a little steadier yourself,
and get manliness and thoughtfulness. And I can
assure you he has watched the experiment ever since with
great satisfaction. Ah! not one of you boys will ever
know the anxiety you have given him, or the care with
which he has watched over every step in your school
lives."</p>

<h4>A NEW LIGHT.</h4>

<p>Up to this time, Tom had never wholly given in to or
understood the Doctor. At first he had thoroughly feared
him. For some years, as I have tried to show, he had
learned to regard him with love and respect, and to think
him a very great, and wise, and good man. But as regarded
his own position in the School, of which he was no little
proud, Tom had no idea of giving any one credit for it
but himself; and the truth to tell, was a very self-conceited
young gentleman on the subject. He was wont to boast
that he had fought his own way fairly up the School, and
had never made up to, or been taken up by any big fellow
or master, and that it was now quite a different place
from what it was when he first came. And, indeed,
though he didn't actually boast of it, yet in his secret soul
he did to a great extent believe that the great reform in
the School had been owing quite as much to himself as to
any one else. Arthur, he acknowledged, had done him
good, and taught him a good deal, so had other boys in
different ways, but they had not had the same means of
influence on the School in general; and as for the Doctor,
why he was a splendid master, but every one knew that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
masters could do very little out of school hours. In short,
he felt on terms of equality with his chief, so far as the
social state of the School was concerned, and thought that
the Doctor would find it no easy matter to get on without
him. Moreover, his School Toryism<a name="FNanchor_50_741" id="FNanchor_50_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_741" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> was still strong, and
he looked still with some jealousy on the Doctor, as somewhat
of a fanatic in the matter of change; and thought it
very desirable for the School that he should have some
wise person (such as himself) to look sharply after vested<a name="FNanchor_51_742" id="FNanchor_51_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_742" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
School rights, and see that nothing was done to the injury
of the republic without due protest.</p>

<p>It was a new light to him to find that, besides teaching
the sixth, and governing and guiding the whole School,
editing classics, and writing histories, the great Headmaster
had found time in those busy years to watch over
the career, even of him, Tom Brown, and his particular
friends&mdash;and, no doubt, of fifty other boys at the same
time; and all this without taking the least credit to himself,
or seeming to know, or let any one else know, he
ever thought particularly of any boy at all.</p>

<h4>HERO-WORSHIP.</h4>

<p>However, the Doctor's victory was complete from that
moment, over Tom Brown, at any rate. He gave way, at
all points, and the enemy marched right over him,&mdash;cavalry,
infantry, and artillery, and the land transport corps,
and the camp followers. It had taken eight long years to
do it, but now it was done thoroughly, and there wasn't
a corner of him left which didn't believe in the Doctor.
Had he returned to school again, and the Doctor began
in the half-year by abolishing fagging, and foot-ball, and
the Saturday half-holiday, or all or any of the most
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
cherished School institutions, Tom would have supported him
with the blindest faith. And so, after a half confession
of his previous short-comings, and sorrowful adieus to his
tutor, from whom he received two beautifully bound volumes
of the Doctor's sermons, as a parting present, he
marched down to the School-house, a hero-worshipper who
would have satisfied the soul of Thomas Carlyle<a name="FNanchor_52_743" id="FNanchor_52_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_743" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> himself.</p>

<p>There he found the eleven at high jinks after supper,
Jack Raggles shouting comic songs, and performing feats
of strength; and was greeted by a chorus of mingled remonstrances
at his desertion and joy at his reappearance.</p>

<p>And falling in with the humor of the evening was soon
as great a boy as all the rest; and at ten o'clock was
chaired<a name="FNanchor_53_744" id="FNanchor_53_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_744" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> round the quadrangle, on one of the hall benches,
borne aloft by the eleven, shouting in chorus, "For he's a
jolly good fellow," while old Thomas, in a melting mood,
and the other School-house servants stood looking on.</p>

<p>And the next morning after breakfast he squared up all
the cricketing accounts, went round to his tradesmen and
other acquaintances, and said his hearty good-byes; and
by twelve o'clock was in the train, and away for London,
no longer a school-boy, and divided his thoughts between
hero-worship, honest regrets over the long stage of his
life which was now slipping out of sight behind him, and
hopes and resolves for the next stage, upon which he was
entering, with all the confidence of a young traveller.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1842, our hero stopped once again at
the well-known station; and, leaving his bag and
fishing-rod with the porter, walked slowly and sadly up
towards the town. It was now July. He had rushed
away from Oxford the moment the term was over, for a
fishing ramble in Scotland with two college friends, and
had been for three weeks living on oat-cake and mutton-hams,
in the wildest parts of Skye.<a name="FNanchor_1_745" id="FNanchor_1_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_745" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> They had descended
one sultry evening on the little inn at Kyle Rhea ferry,
and, while Tom and another of the party put their tackle
together and began exploring the stream for a sea-trout
for supper, the third strolled into the house to arrange
for their entertainment. Presently, he came out in a
loose blouse and slippers, a short pipe in his mouth, and
an old newspaper in his hand, and threw himself on the
heathery scrub<a name="FNanchor_2_746" id="FNanchor_2_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_746" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> which met the shingle,<a name="FNanchor_3_747" id="FNanchor_3_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_747" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> within easy hail of
the fishermen. There he lay, the picture of free-and-easy,
loafing, hand-to-mouth young England, "improving his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
mind," as he shouted to them, by the perusal of the fortnight-old
weekly paper, soiled with the marks of toddy-glasses
and tobacco-ashes, the legacy of the last traveller,
which he had hunted out from the kitchen of the little
hostelry,<a name="FNanchor_4_748" id="FNanchor_4_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_748" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and, being a youth of a communicative turn of
mind, began imparting the contents to the fishermen as he
went on.</p>

<p>"What a bother they are making about these wretched
Corn-laws!<a name="FNanchor_5_749" id="FNanchor_5_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_749" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Here's three or four columns full of nothing
but sliding-scales and fixed duties.<a name="FNanchor_6_750" id="FNanchor_6_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_750" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Hang this tobacco,
it's always going out! Ah, here's something better,&mdash;a
splendid match between Kent and England, Brown! Kent
winning by three wickets. Felix fifty-six runs without a
chance, and not out!"</p>

<p>Tom, intent on a fish which had risen at him twice,
answered only with a grunt.</p>

<p>"Anything about the Goodwood?"<a name="FNanchor_7_751" id="FNanchor_7_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_751" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> called out the third
man.</p>

<p>"Rory O'More drawn. Butterfly colt amiss," shouted
the student.</p>

<p>"Just my luck," grumbled the inquirer, jerking his
flies<a name="FNanchor_8_752" id="FNanchor_8_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_752" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> off the water, and throwing again with a heavy
sullen splash, and frightening Tom's fish.</p>

<p>"I say, can't you throw lighter over there? We aren't
fishing for grampuses," shouted Tom across the stream.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Brown! here's something for you," called out
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
the reading man next moment; "why, your old master,
Arnold<a name="FNanchor_9_753" id="FNanchor_9_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_753" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> of Rugby, is dead."</p>

<p>Tom's hand stopped half-way in his cast,<a name="FNanchor_10_754" id="FNanchor_10_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_754" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and his line
and flies went all tangling round and round his rod; you
might have knocked him over with a feather. Neither of
his companions took any notice of him, luckily; and with
a violent effort he set to work mechanically to disentangle
his line. He felt completely carried off his moral and
intellectual legs, as if he had lost his standing-point in the
invisible world. Besides which, the deep loving loyalty
which he had felt for his old leader made the shock intensely
painful. It was the first great wrench of his life,
the first gap which the angel Death had made in his circle,
and he felt numbed, and beaten down and spiritless.
Well, well! I believe it was good for him and for many
others in like case, who had to learn by that loss that the
soul of man cannot stand or lean upon any human prop,
however strong, and wise, and good; but that He upon
whom alone it can stand and lean will knock away all such
props in His own wise and merciful way, until there is no
ground or stay left but Himself, the Rock of Ages, upon
whom alone a sure foundation for every soul of man is laid.</p>

<p>As he wearily labored at his line, the thought struck
him: "It may be all false, a mere newspaper lie," and he
strode up to the recumbent smoker.</p>

<p>"Let me look at the paper," said he.</p>

<p>"Nothing else in it," answered the other, handing it up
to him listlessly.<a name="FNanchor_11_755" id="FNanchor_11_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_755" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> "Hullo, Brown! what's the matter,
old fellow&mdash;aren't you well?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
"Where is it?" said Tom, turning over the leaves, his
hand trembling, and his eyes swimming, so that he could
not read.</p>

<p>"What? What are you looking for?" said his friend,
jumping up and looking over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"That&mdash;about Arnold," said Tom.</p>

<p>"Oh, here," said the other, putting his finger on the
paragraph. Tom read it over and over again; there could
be no mistake of identity, though the account was short
enough.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said he at last, dropping the paper; "I
shall go for a walk; don't you and Herbert wait supper
for me." And away he strode, up over the moor at the
back of the house, to be alone, and master his grief if
possible.</p>

<p>His friend looked after him, sympathizing and wondering;
and, knocking the ashes out of his pipe, walked over
to Herbert. After a short parley,<a name="FNanchor_12_756" id="FNanchor_12_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_756" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> they walked together
up to the house.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid that confounded newspaper has spoiled
Brown's fun for this trip."</p>

<p>"How odd that he should be so fond of his old master,"
said Herbert. Yet they, also, were both public-school
men.</p>

<p>The two, however, notwithstanding Tom's prohibition,
waited supper for him, and had everything ready when he
came back some half an hour afterward. But he could
not join in their cheerful talk, and the party was soon
silent, notwithstanding the efforts of all three. One
thing only had Tom resolved, and that was that he couldn't
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
stay in Scotland any longer; he felt an irresistible longing
to get to Rugby, and then home, and soon broke it to the
others, who had too much tact to oppose.</p>

<p>So by daylight the next morning he was marching
through Ross-shire, and in the evening hit the Caledonian
canal, took the next steamer, and travelled as fast as boat
and railway could carry him to the Rugby station.</p>

<p>As he walked up to the town, he felt shy and afraid of
being seen, and took the back streets; why, he didn't
know; but he followed his instinct. At the school-gates
he made a dead pause; there was not a soul in the quadrangle,&mdash;all
was lonely, and silent, and sad. So with another
effort he strode through the quadrangle, and into
the School-house offices.<a name="FNanchor_13_757" id="FNanchor_13_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_757" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>He found the little matron in her room in deep mourning,
shook her hand, tried to talk, and moved nervously
about; she was evidently thinking of the same subject as
he, but he couldn't begin talking.</p>

<p>"Where shall I find Thomas?" said he at last, getting
desperate.</p>

<p>"In the servants' hall, I think, sir. But won't you
take anything?" said the matron, looking rather disappointed.</p>

<p>"No, thank you," said he, and strode off again to find
the old verger, who was sitting in his little den as of old,
puzzling over hieroglyphics.<a name="FNanchor_14_758" id="FNanchor_14_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_758" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>He looked up through his spectacles, as Tom seized his
hand and wrung it.</p>

<p>"Ah! you heard all about it, sir, I see," said he.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
Tom nodded, and then sat down on the shoe-board,
while the old man told his tale, and wiped his spectacles,
and fairly flowed over with quaint, homely, honest sorrow.</p>

<p>By the time he had done, Tom felt much better.</p>

<p>"Where is he buried, Thomas?" said he at last.</p>

<p>"Under the altar in the chapel,<a name="FNanchor_15_759" id="FNanchor_15_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_759" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> sir," answered Thomas.
"You'd like to have the key, I dare say."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Thomas&mdash;yes, I should very much."
And the old man fumbled among his bunch, and then got
up, as though he would go with him; but after a few
steps stopped short, and said: "Perhaps you'd like to go
by yourself, sir?"</p>

<p>Tom nodded, and the bunch of keys were handed to
him with an injunction to be sure and lock the door after
him, and bring them back before eight o'clock.</p>

<p>He walked quickly through the quadrangle and out
into the close. The longing which had been upon him
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
and driven him thus far, like the gad-fly<a name="FNanchor_16_760" id="FNanchor_16_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_760" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> in the Greek
legends, giving him no rest in mind or body, seemed all
of a sudden not to be satisfied, but to shrivel up, and
pall.<a name="FNanchor_17_761" id="FNanchor_17_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_761" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> "Why should I go on? It's no use," he thought,
and threw himself at full length on the turf, and looked
vaguely and listlessly at all the well-known objects.
There were a few of the town-boys playing cricket, their
wicket pitched on the best piece in the middle of the big-side
ground,&mdash;a sin about equal to sacrilege in the eyes of
a captain of the eleven. He was very nearly getting up
to go and send them off. "Pshaw! they won't remember
me. They've more right there than I," he muttered.
And the thought that his sceptre had departed, and his
mark was wearing out, came home to him for the first
time, and bitterly enough. He was lying on the very
spot where the fights came off; where he himself had
fought six years ago his first and last battle. He conjured
up the scene till he could almost hear the shouts of
the ring, and East's whisper in his ear; and looking across
the close to the Doctor's private door, half expected to
see it open, and the tall figure in cap and gown come
striding under the elm-trees toward him.</p>

<p>No, no! that sight could never be seen again. There
was no flag flying on the round tower;<a name="FNanchor_18_762" id="FNanchor_18_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_762" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> the School-house
windows were all shuttered up; and when the flag went
up again, and the shutters came down, it would be to welcome
a stranger. All that was left on earth of him whom
he had honored, was lying cold and still under the chapel
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
floor. He would go in and see the place once more, and
then leave it once for all. New men and new methods
might do for other people; let those who would, worship
the rising star; he at least would be faithful to the sun
which had set. And so he got up, and walked to the
chapel door and unlocked it, fancying himself the only
mourner in all the broad land, and feeding on his own
selfish sorrow.</p>

<p>He passed through the vestibule<a name="FNanchor_19_763" id="FNanchor_19_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_763" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and then paused for
a moment to glance over the empty benches. His heart
was still proud and high, and he walked up to the seat
which he had last occupied as a sixth-form boy, and sat
himself down there to collect his thoughts.</p>

<p>And, truth to tell, they needed collecting and setting
in order not a little. The memories of eight years were
all dancing through his brain, and carrying him about
whither they would; while beneath them all, his heart
was throbbing with a dull sense of a loss that could never
be made up to him. The rays of the evening sun came
solemnly through the painted windows above his head,
and fell in gorgeous colors on the opposite wall, and the
perfect stillness soothed his spirit little by little. And he
turned to the pulpit, and looked at it, and then, leaning
forward with his head on his hands, groaned aloud, "If
he could only have seen the Doctor again for one five
minutes, have told him all that was in his heart, what he
owed to him, how he loved and reverenced him, and would,
by God's help, follow his steps in life and death, he could
have borne it all without a murmur. But that he should
have gone away forever without knowing it all, was too
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
much to bear. But am I sure that he does not know it
all?"&mdash;the thought made him start. "May he not even
now be near me, in this very chapel? If he be, am I sorrowing
as he would have me sorrow&mdash;as I should wish
to have sorrowed when I shall meet him again?"</p>

<p>He raised himself up and looked round; and after a
minute rose and walked humbly down to the lowest bench,
and sat down on the very seat which he had occupied on
his first Sunday at Rugby. And then the old memories
rushed back again, but softened and subdued, and soothing
him as he felt himself carried away by them. And
he looked up at the great painted window above the altar,
and remembered how when a little boy he used to try not
to look through it at the elm-trees and the rooks, before
the painted glass came&mdash;and the subscription for the
painted glass, and the letter he wrote home for money to
give to it. And there, down below, was the very name of
the boy who sat on his right hand on that first day,
scratched rudely in the oak panelling.</p>

<p>And then came the thought of all his old schoolfellows;
and form after form of boys, nobler and braver and purer
than he, rose up and seemed to rebuke him. Could he
not think of them, and what they had felt and were feeling,
they who had honored and loved from the first the
man whom he had taken years to know and love? Could
he not think of those yet dearer to him who were gone,
who bore his name and shared his blood, and were now
without a husband or a father? Then the grief which he
began to share with others became gentle and holy, and
he rose up once more, and walked up the steps to the
altar, and, while the tears flowed freely down his cheeks,
knelt down humbly and hopefully, to lay down there his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
share of a burden which had proved itself too heavy for
him to bear in his own strength.</p>

<p>Here let us leave him&mdash;where better could we leave
him than at the altar, before which he had first caught a
glimpse of the glory of his birth-right,<a name="FNanchor_20_764" id="FNanchor_20_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_764" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and felt the dawning
of the bond which links all living souls together in one
brotherhood&mdash;at the grave, beneath the altar, of him who
had opened his eyes to see that glory, and softened his
heart till it could feel that bond?</p>

<p>And let us not be hard on him, if at that moment his
soul is fuller of the tomb and him who lies there than of
the altar and Him of whom it speaks. Such stages have
to be gone through, I believe, by all young and brave
souls who must win their way, through hero worship, to
the worship of Him who is the King and Lord of heroes.
For it is only through our mysterious human relationships,
through the love, and tenderness, and purity of mothers,
and sisters, and wives, through the strength, and courage,
and wisdom of fathers, and brothers, and teachers, that we
can come to the knowledge of Him, in whom alone the
love, and the tenderness, and the purity, and the strength,
and the courage, and the wisdom of all these dwell for
ever and ever in perfect fulness.</p>
